"He always acts so pissy and petty about Gwen — buddy, YOU'RE the one who cheated," said the fan.

After taking a paternity test, he was proven to be the dad of then-15-year-old model, Daisy Lowe. Two years later, he welcomed his first child with Gwen — Kingston James McGregor Rossdale.

When asked about the rumors about Rossdale's infidelity, she hinted: "All you have to do is listen to every single song I've ever written, and it's all there.

That was a moment where I was feeling just as bad as I feel today, and why did I keep it up?'" In 2020, Rossdale told The Guardian that their divorce was the "most embarrassing moment" of his life."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Blake Shelton Really Feels About Gwen Stefani's Bare 'No Makeup' Look</a></span></p><h2 id=why-gwen-stefani-and-gavin-rossdale-39-don-39-t-co-parent-39>Why Gwen Stefani And Gavin Rossdale 'Don't Co-Parent'</h2><p>In an interview with the Not So Hollywood podcast in June 2023, Rossdale admitted that he and Stefani "don't co-parent" due to their opposing views, which he thinks offer their children an "incredible perspective."
