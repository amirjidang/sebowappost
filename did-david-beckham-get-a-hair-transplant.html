Here's the truth about his famous hair.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/what-happened-to-david-beckham-s-former-pr-assistant_-rebecca-loos_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>What Happened To David Beckham's Former PR Assistant Rebecca Loos After Their Affair Allegation?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>David Beckham called the accusation "ludicrous", but it didn't stop Rebecca Loos from making a lot of money.</span><h2 id=what-hairstyles-has-david-beckham-had>What Hairstyles Has David Beckham Had?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/f5udx8iwkaamkwm.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>David has probably had every male hairstyle there is. He's had a mullet, a mohawk, that 2000s middle part, an undercut, a sexy ponytail, and even cornrows. He's literally had it all — from buzzcut to long hair. But in the last few years, he's most known for "The Pompadour," which was nicknamed the "David Beckham Haircut."</p><p>In 2018, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ released a guide</a> on how to achieve that look. Artistic barber, Carmelo Guastella gave the magazine's writer, Teo van den Broeke the new hairdo back then. "Beckham's new 'do is a classic crew cut with skin fade on the sides. When you go to the barber, ask for a high fade 0.5 mm (clippers) blended at the temple with a rounded shape," explained Guastella.</p><p>"The top (fringe) is like a short Pompadour at about 1.5-2 cm graduated to the crown at about 1.5 cm," he continued. "Taking the crown short will give the fringe a bit of lift. (The top should be cut with scissors and point cutting technique should be used)." For anyone trying to get the 'do, the men's grooming expert suggested that "this haircut suits mostly oval faces, but square faces can handle the style too."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's also "very easy to maintain." Guastella added: "It's a nonfuss haircut, it's easy and quick to style and - most importantly - it makes David look younger, which means it'll make you look younger too. The shaggy crop requires reshaping every two to three weeks to look always sharp."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/nicola-peltz-and-brooklyn-beckham-s-over-the-top-lifestyle-reveals-just-how-huge-their-net-worth-really-is.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Nicola Peltz And Brooklyn Beckham's Over The Top Lifestyle Reveals Just How Huge Their Net Worth Really Is</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>How much money do Nicola Peltz and Brooklyn Beckham have and what do they choose to spend it on?</span><h2 id=did-david-beckham-get-a-hair-transplant>Did David Beckham Get A Hair Transplant?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar52953972.jpg><p>The downside of David's hair being in the spotlight is that his hair loss has been monitored by many, hence the hair transplant speculations. The retired soccer star had a widow's peak that later showed signs of Androgenetic Alopecia (Male Pattern Baldness) in 2013, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">per Natural Hair Turkey.</a> At that time, he also had a bald patch on the crown of his head.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Five years later, David debuted his lush pompadour, which sparked rumors that he had a hair transplant. After all, other athletes like Cristiano Ronaldo and Tom Brady have notably had the procedure. According to Natural Hair's evaluation, he most likely had FUE "because FUE transplant offers effective results for thinning hair types and for complete coverage as in Beckham's example."</p><p>Another telltale sign could be that Beckham didn't have any scars. Experts say that FUE would have been the best choice for David's receding hairline as it yields natural-looking results. It "is a technique in which healthy hair follicles are implanted into the area to be transplanted, does not cause any scars or wounds while applying the most suitable hair density to the person," per the leading hair transplantation clinic.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/david-and-victoria-beckham-are-avoiding-questions-after-reportedly-cutting-ties-with-meghan-markle-and-prince-harry.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>David And Victoria Beckham Are Avoiding Questions After Reportedly Cutting Ties With Meghan Markle And Prince Harry</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The Beckhams have had enough after Harry and Meghan accused them of spreading lies to the press.</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-david-beckham-shave-his-head-recently>Why Did David Beckham Shave His Head Recently?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar53098399.jpg><p>David first publicly sported a buzzcut in 2000. At that time, people thought he did it for attention. He recently denied the claims and explained why he shaved his head again recently. "Nothing much changes," he wrote in an Instagram Story alongside a snap of his déjà vu look. "[I] get bored of my hair [and] chop it off."</p><p>In his new <strong><a href=#>Netflix</a></strong> documentary, Beckham, the father of four recalled the time he decided to go bald in 2000. "I had a hairdresser at the time called Tyler. I said to him: 'I'm gonna cut my hair' and he was like: 'Are you sure? You really want to do that?'" he remembered, adding that his Manchester United Coach, Sir Alex Ferguson called it "stubbornness."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"And [Ferugson] said: 'David, take the cap off,' and I said 'no,'" David said of that time he was hiding his new 'do in a cap. Ferguson said that at that time, he just said, "Oh well." Back then, commentators said things like, "the blonde locks have gone" and that "the sight ... will take a bit of getting used to."</p><p>It was such a huge deal that "When David Beckham shaved his head, I honestly thought a member of my family had died," said Manchester paparazzo, James Clarke. "Because my phone went off. The panic in people's voices that this… We haven’t got it documented yet." But it wasn't even the craziest part of David's hair journey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Right after Victoria had just given birth to their third child, Cruz Beckham, the former footballer asked his wife to check if his hair was okay before meeting the press outside the hospital. <a href=#>Posh Spice</a> also admitted to being "pissed" that David was hanging out with <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a></strong> and <strong><a href=#>Beyoncé</a></strong> that morning she was in labor and in need of a C-section.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdma63tcNmmZ6bm52urnnGnqtmmV2drqq%2BjK2pmqajpbmiutNo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./dj-ashba-wife-net-worth-tattoos-smoking-body-facts.html>&#171;&nbsp;DJ Ashba: Wife, net worth, tattoos, smoking &amp;amp; body facts</a>
