The <a href=#>sadness Brooke Shields felt as a young star</a> was thanks to how <a href=#>inappropriate the media was</a>. She shares it all in her Hulu documentary series Pretty Baby.

In 1978, she starred in the controversial Pretty Baby. Her other famous roles included Emmeline Lestrange in 1980's The Blue Lagoon and Jade Butterfield in 1981's Endless Love. Although Shields's salaries haven't been talked about publicly, if she was making $10,000 for each day during her modeling career, it's possible that she made even more for each movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-blue-lagoon-brooke-shields.jpg><p>Of course, movie salaries have increased recently. When The Blue Lagoon was made, the budget was $4.5 million, so it's unlikely that each actor was making millions for the film.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Following His Rant On The Today Show, Tom Cruise Showed Up To Brooke Shields' Home</a></span></p><p>Brooke Shields not only accumulated much of her $40 million net worth as a young actress, but it sounds like she needed the escape of movie-making. She shared in Pretty Baby that her mother Teri struggled with drinking. And according to The Guardian, when Shields wrote her 2014 memoir "There Was A Little Girl," she mentioned why she liked filming movies so much.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/brooke-shields-walking-outside.jpg><p>Shields wrote, “If not for the entertainment industry, I would have been a train wreck,” she writes in her memoir. “The movie business kept me afloat and sane.”</p><h2 id=what-did-young-brooke-shields-get-paid-for-modeling-and-calvin-klein-ads>What Did Young Brooke Shields Get Paid For Modeling And Calvin Klein Ads?</h2><p>The Pretty Baby documentary series shared that young Brooke Shields was a model whose mother encouraged her to work as a baby. And as she grew up, she became more and more popular.</p><p>Celebrity Net Worth reported that Brooke Shields made $10,000 per day when she was a young model. As Pretty Baby explained, Shields seemed to work constantly as a child and teenager, and the money seemed to be pouring in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a href=#>media was unfair about Brooke Shields's Calvin Klein ads</a>.

Nothing." They quickly became the talk of the town and everyone had an opinion. Many said that Shields, who was a teenager at the time, was too young to say something like that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2021, the actress was interviewed by Vogue and shared that she didn't realize the message behind the ads at the time. She said, "I was a kid, and where I was, I was naive. I was a very protected, sequestered, young woman in a bubble. I think the assumption was that I was much more savvy than I ever really was."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/brooke-shields-documentary-pretty-baby-on-hulu-red-carpet.jpg><p>Even though young Brooke Shields made good money as a model, her mother would spend her earnings and that meant that it went pretty quickly. According to MSNBC, Shields was interviewed by Know Your Value and she said, “When I was 20 years into my career, I had made and lost everything twice. My mom's perspective was, if I did a movie, we could buy a house, or if I did a job, we could get a car. Her financial philosophy was [that] we work to live for the now, not for the future.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-money-did-brooke-shields-make-later-on-in-her-acting-career>What Money Did Brooke Shields Make Later On In Her Acting Career?</h2><p>Brooke Shields has definitely been acting on a consistent basis since her first role in the 1978 movie Pretty Baby. She hasn't starred in any major movies in the past few decades. However, that could be because she's carefully choosing how she wants to spend her time. Shields married Chris Henchy in 2001 and the couple has two daughters, Grier and Rowan.</p><p>While Shields played River Fields in 14 episodes of Jane The Virgin, she has mostly guest-starred on different TV shows over the years. These roles would have paid well since she's a big star. However, they wouldn't pay as much as a major role on a long-running TV series.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kathy Griffin's Stand-Up Routine Ruined Her Friendship With Brooke Shields</a></span></p><p>Brooke Shields played a flower shop owner named Abby Knight in the Hallmark movie series Flower Shop Mysteries that aired in the 2010s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SAG rates from 2022</a>, the "SAG Basic Theatrical Scale" requires an actor to be paid between $1,082-$1,088 per day and $3,756-$3,774 per week. Since Shields is a big star, her team could likely negotiate a higher day and weekly rate. Since she starred in three Flower Shop Mysteries movies, it's possible that she would have been paid well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/brooke-shields.jpg><p>In an interview with TV Insider, the actress shared that she agreed to the movies because she was interested in producing. She said, "Hallmark agreed to let me be an executive producer. I wanted to really be involved and be part of something I could learn from. It was my first foray into executive producing. It’s been a real education for me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When looking at the movies that Brooke Shields starred in when she was young and what projects she agreed to in her later years, she definitely starred in bigger movies early on. After 2000, she starred in the horror movie The Midnight Meat Train in 2008. There was the romantic comedy Chalet Girl in 2011. And in 2021, she starred in the Netflix Christmas movie A Castle For Christmas. She likely did well from these movies, although her salaries aren't available.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIympqedqWKxqrCMsqauppdir7O7zqScZquYnrKtsNJmpJqjlWKupMDIp55mm5Gnsqa%2BjKecrWWnpL%2B1tI4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./edward-furlong-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Edward Furlong Net Worth How Much is Furlong Worth?</a>
