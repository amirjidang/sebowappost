Rutherford was involved in the show business from a young age, participating in talent shows and creating music. He played with multiple local bands in his city and around the school before releasing solo music. In 2011, Rutherford co-created the band Neighborhood, which <a href=#>released a mix of hip-hop, rock</a>, and indie music with a niche audience.

He uploaded singles on the platform under the alias but opted for his real name while releasing his first solo single, <i>Born To Be Blonde</i>. In 2017, his debut studio album <i>&</i> was released with 11 tracks and no other featured artists.
