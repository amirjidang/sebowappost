Released through Big Machine, a recording label that had been her home since 2005, 1989 was supported with singles like Shake It Off, Blank Space, Style, and many more. The 9-times-platinum album marked Taylor's departure from her earlier signature country sound to straightforward pop.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"With 1989, I was really putting my neck on the line, because I was the one saying I need to change directions musically," T-Swizz told <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TIME</a>. "I didn't want people to know the emotional DNA of this album. I didn't want them to see a smiling picture on the cover and think this was a happy album, or see a sad-looking facial expression and think, oh, this is another breakup record."</p><p>Debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart with 1.2 million first-week sales, 1989 spent 11 non-consecutive weeks on the top, making it the fourth album along with her Fearless album, Adele's 21, and the&nbsp;Frozen movie soundtrack to spend more than ten weeks at number one. It might have been six years since the album's release, but the album is still worth every listen.

She was born on December 13, hence her 'lucky' number, in West Reading, Pennsylvania. She was only nine when she found her passion in music and performed in four Berks Youth Theater Academy productions. She has a younger brother, named Austin, as photographed on this picture!</p><h2 id=blank-space-amp-shake-it-off-weren-t-the-first-time-taylor-clapped-back-at-critics-using-her-song><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Blank Space&nbsp;& Shake It Off&nbsp;Weren't The First Time Taylor Clapped Back At Critics Using Her Song</span></h2><p>Taylor's music is mainly built from all the drama in her life, and that's what makes so many people resonate with her music because it's real. Taylor clapped back at critics on Shake It Off, the lead single from 1989, but it wasn't the first time Taylor used her music to counter haters. Speaking to <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">90 Minutes</a>, Tay revealed the real subject behind her 2011 single Mean was blogger Bob Lefsetz who criticized her Grammy performance with Stevie Nicks back in 2010.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The things that were said about me by this dude just floored me and like leveled me.

In the dream, my ex had come to the door to beg for me to talk to him or whatever, and I opened up the door, and I went to go say, "Hi," or "What are you doing here?" or something—something normal—but all that came out was this high-pitched singing that said, "Stay!" It was almost operatic. So I wrote this song, and I used that sound in the song."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Old Taylor Can’t Come To The Phone: Facts About Taylor Swift’s Reputation Album</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=50-cent-is-secretly-a-fan-of-the-album><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>50 Cent Is, Secretly, A Fan Of The Album</span></h2><p>Every one of us has a guilty pleasure, even a gangsta rapper like Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson, and admitting it is no sin. Speaking to <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Larry King</a>, In da Club rapper said that he'd been secretly a fan of Taylor's 1989. He said, "I like Taylor Swift's new (1989) CD." Surprised, the interviewer nodded his head and re-asked him the question, which he firmly answered, "Taylor Swift's new CD."</p><p>It wasn't the first time 50 stood up for Taylor and her art, in any case. Following the infamous Kanye West's 'I'ma let you finish' outburst at the 2009 VMAs, 50 sided with the singer.</p><p>"At that point, you can't replace it," 50 told MuchMusic, as reported by <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MTV</a>. "Even an apology can't replace what it feels like for the very first time receiving that award. Now in her head, 'My first award was Kanye West.' And it's damaging. I wish he would come take one of my awards so I can black his eye in front of everybody."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=goodbye-nashville><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Goodbye, Nashville</span></h2><p>Not only did Taylor Swift move to a whole new genre with 1989, but she also relocated to New York from Nashville. She even paid homage to the Empire State by titling the album's opener as Welcome to New York. Speaking to <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! Online</a>, here's what Tay Tay said about the song, "I approached moving there with such wide-eyed optimism and sort of saw it as a place of endless potential and possibilities.

"She basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people (dancers) out from under me. And I'm surprisingly non-confrontational – you would not believe how much I hate conflict. So now I have to avoid her.
