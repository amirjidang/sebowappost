"crowd work," in part because he initially came to fame via brief clips he shared as "shorts" or "reels."</p><p>Speaking to the newspaper, Rife observed that the popularity of such clips online sometimes created the misperception that crowd work is "all [Rife] can do," and he explained how the content of his sets differed from his popular reels:</p><p>"They [audience members] think that because you only post crowd work that that’s all you can do, and it’s like, ‘No, I don’t want you to pay to come see me in person to see the exact same jokes you just saw for free.'"</p><strong
