The MTV series, which premiered in 2004, followed the lives of a group of teenagers in California. By then, Kristin was a high school junior and was in a relationship with her first boyfriend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Laguna Beach, Kristin went on to star in another reality TV series, The Hills. This show focused on the lives of several young working-class women among them Kristin. Kristin was no longer with her high school sweetheart. Instead, she had a few high profile relationships, some involving her costars and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one involving a camera crewmember</a>. Kristin denies that some relationships ever took place and one of the ones she admits to will shock a few people.</p><p>Kristin met her ex-husband Jay Cutler in 2010. After about a year of dating, the couple got engaged. The pair married in 2013. By then they had one child together. Kristin and Jay recently announced that they were separating after 10 years together and their fans are heartbroken over the news much more than they were when she ended her relationship with these men:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stephen-colletti><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><strong>Stephen Colletti</strong></span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Colletti was Kristin’s first love</a>. Part of their relationship was played out in the series Laguna Beach. Stephen and Kristin had been together for a year before filming of the show began. The show also featured a love triangle between the couple and another castmate, Lauren Conrad. Colletti continued to build his acting career and has appeared in successful projects such as the series One Tree Hill and Hit The Floor, as well as films such as The Suicide Note, and The Wedding Do Over.</p><p>Colletti prefers to keep his personal life private, so we are not sure whether he has someone in his life or if he's flying solo.</p><h2 id=talan-torriero><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><strong>Talan Torriero</strong></span></h2><p>Although Kristin and Stephen adored each other, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their relationship did not last long after Laguna Beach</a>. After the breakup, Kristin dated Talan Torriero who was also another cast of Laguna Beach. Talan was not one of the main stars but he was friends with the main characters. Their relationship did not also last for long. Talan continued to pursue his career as an actor and producer, and people know him for his roles in American High School, and The Killing Jar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In July 2014, Talan tied the knot with Danielle Torriero, and the two appear to be happy together.</p><h2 id=brody-jenner><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><strong>Brody Jenner</strong></span></h2><p>Many people know Brody Jenner from the TV show, The Hills. Brody is also Kylie and Kendall Jenner’s half-brother. He also starred in another series, Bromance. Kristin dated Brody when she was 18 years old. This was right after Laguna Beach. Brody and Kristin also appeared together in The Hills. Brody was the host and executive producer of Bromance, a reality show about men who were competing to be in his entourage. in 2018, Brody and his then-girlfriend Kaitlynn Carter had what appeared to be a wedding in Indonesia.</p><p>However, in 2019, the couple split up and claimed that their union was not legal, at least in the U.S.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Things Kristin Cavallari Likely Wants Everyone To Forget About</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matt-leinart><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><strong>Matt Leinart</strong></span></h2><p>After Laguna Beach finished filming, Kristin started dating other people that were not part of the show. She started seeing USC’S star quarterback, Matt Leinart in 2006 but this relationship was also short-lived. In 2008, they were seen together in Las Vegas but the ex-couple never rekindled their romance. These days, Leinart is married to Josie Loren, an actress famous for her roles in The Mentalist and Make It or Break It. They have been together since 2018.</p><h2 id=brody-jenner-again><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>Brody Jenner Again</strong></span></h2><p>By the time Brody and Kristin were featuring in The Hills, they had already broken up. This just confirms over and over just how fake the "reality" shows are. Regardless of what was happening in the real world, these two had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an onscreen romance that Kristin admits was not real</a>. Brody was at the time dating a playboy model Jayde Nicole. In the show, Brody and Kristin only dated for a few episodes before Kristin left town at the series finale, which the producers of the show tried to make as emotional as possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Therefore, even though the relationship was fake this time around, it still makes it on this list.</p><h2 id=nick-lachey><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>Nick Lachey</strong></span></h2><p>Kristin was also linked to 98 Degrees singer, Nick Lachey in the mid-2000s. Nick had just broken up with Jessica Simpson at the time and Kristin was single. Kristin denied the dating rumors. She insists that she and Nick were just friends and have never been romantically involved.</p><p>Today, Lachey is married to Vanessa Minnillo, with whom they have three children. Coincidentally, Nick and Kristin's sons are both called Camden. These two met on Lachey's 2006 "What's Left of Me" music video. They got married in 2011 on Necker Island, Richard Branson's Island.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An Inside Look: Kristin Cavallari And Jay Cutler's Divorce</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nick-zano><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>Nick Zano</strong></span></h2><p>Sometime between 2006 and 2007, Kristin dated actor Nick Zano who is popular for his appearance in the sitcom What I Like About You. This relationship was serious seeing that Kristin had a tattoo of Nick’s initials on her wrist. The couple split late 2007 after which Kristin had the tattoo removed. Zano went through a few relationships until 2016 when he and his girlfriend, Leah Renee Cudmore had their first child together.</p><p>Since then this couple has been together and even had a second child in 2018. Leah is an actress from Canada.</p><h2 id=chris-evans><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>Chris Evans</strong></span></h2><p>This is another relationship <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristin insists did not happen</a>. Chris and Kristin met through mutual friends and were pals for some time before people started speculating that they were an item. They cannot blame us for thinking that they were together, especially after we saw the pair together at the Mayfair Hotel in Miami. For some reason, this Avengers: Endgame star is still single, though sources claim that he is enjoying life and is going out on dates. One of his most recent relationships was with his ex Jenny Slate, who they dated for less than a year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristin Cavallari And Jay Cutler...

Justin and Kristin were also involved in a love triangle with another castmate, Audrina Patridge. As was her relationship with Brody, this one was also all for show. Patridge also admitted the same at the show’s 10th anniversary.</p><p>Justin and Audrina met for the first time when he was Maroon 5's hairdresser, and they allegedly were together for quite some time. However, this relationship was the on again off again type, and it was one for the cameras, so we can never really know whether these two had anything serious going on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=miguel-medina><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>Miguel Medina</strong></span></h2><p>While viewers were led to believe that Kristin was dating Brody and Justin during the filming of The Hills, the reality TV star was secretly dating one of the cameramen, Miguel Medina. Her costars did not also know of the relationship until paparazzi took a photo of the couple at an airport. Filming of The Hills was just a week away from the ending, so this relationship coming to light did not do any damage to the show.</p><p>This was arguably one of her serious relationships, which she does not regret having. Miguel keeps a low profile and we are not sure if he is currently in a relationship.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristin Cavallari Is Upset With Losing BFF Kelly Henderson Over Cheating Rumors</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">usmagazine.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cheatsheet.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">eonline.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihmrFdmMK1uMSrZKCtqah6rL7IrKuipl2Yrrety6WYq6Fdna60ecClqqhllJbBprCMm6aynqKesq%2Bw0macsZ2jZA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ariana-grande-massive-net-worth-source-youtube.html>&#171;&nbsp;Part Of Ariana Grande's Massive Net Worth Comes From A Surprising Source</a>
