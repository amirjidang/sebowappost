It sounds like they are truly in love.</p><p>The couple met while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">starring in The Merchant Of Venice </a>and according to The New York Times, they played the roles of Bassanio and Portia in a 2010 Shakespeare In The Park production. They then were cast in the Broadway play Seminar in 2011.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple is definitely very private about their love story, with Alexis Soloski writing for The New York Times in 2015, "Ms. Rabe and Mr. Linklater are in love themselves, though that’s an aspect of their lives they prefer not to discuss in great detail. (Or rather, they’ll discuss it freely, only to follow up with a flurry of courteous, contrite emails asking that these matters be left mostly private.)"</p><p>Lily Rabe often talks about Hamish Linklater on his Instagram account. When he celebrated his birthday this past July 8th, she wrote, "It’s his birthday and I really love him."</p><p>Hamish shares his love for his partner as well: on her birthday on June 29th, he wrote on Instagram, "Happy Birthday, Dearest and most Darling @lilyrabe. YOU TAKE THE CAKE. I love you #tbb which i really really hope means throw back birthdays."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Cast Of 'American Horror Story' Season 10 Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></span></p><h2></h2><h2 id=parents>Parents</h2><p>Hamish and Lily are also parents to two babies: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lily gave birth to their second child</a> in the summer of 2020.</p><p>According to People, the couple had their first baby back in 2017, and Hamish has a daughter named Lucinda Rose from a relationship that he was in before dating Lily.</p><p>Page Six reported that Lily is now expecting her third baby.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why 'American Horror Story' Can Be So Controversial</a></span></p><h2 id=serious-actors>Serious Actors</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both Lily Rabe and Hamish Linklater have fascinating acting resumes. While Lily is famous for starring in American Horror Story, she played Sylvia in the HBO drama The Undoing, Emma/Karen in Tell Me Your Secrets, and had roles on The Good Wife and The Whispers along with some movies.</p><p>Hamish is creating lots of buzz right now for playing Father Paul in Netflix's Midnight Mass and his previous roles show a lot of range. Hamish played Jerry in The Newsroom, Matthew on the sitcom The New Adventures Of Old Christine, and Pvt. Stan Silver on American Dreams.</p><p>While the couple has acted together in Shakespearean plays, they both starred in the TV mystery Tell Me Your Secrets.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with Collider, Hamish Linklater shared that he wanted to play the role of John in this project because he loves working with his wife and also loved the story. He said, "There were a lot of elements that drew me to it. As it turned out, Lily [Rabe] was doing it, so any opportunity to work with her, but it started with the writing and the character. I hadn’t played a character like that on film, and I didn’t know where it was gonna go or if I’d be able to do it well, so it seemed like a really worthwhile journey to go on."</p><p>Lily told Stylecaster.com that the people behind Tell Me Your Secrets really wanted Hamish to star on the show and they were amazed to learn that they were a couple, so it sounds like it worked out perfectly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lily explained, “I was cast first and Bruna called me and was like, ‘It’s so wild. I knew you were together of course, but no one else in the room did. We were talking about our dream people for this part and everyone started talking about Hamish.’ Bruna said at a certain point, ‘You know they have children and a family.’ Everyone was just shocked."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Evan Peters' Time On 'American Horror Story'</a></span></p><p>While Hamish Linklater and Lily Rabe might keep their relationship out of the spotlight, they appear to be super happy and fans can always check out Tell Me Your Secrets to see them act together on the small screen.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>What Emma Roberts Really Thinks Of Starring In The ‘American Horror Story’ Series</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6rbXLsmSrmZKaeqK6w2afmqWZqLVuuMinoqWZpJq%2FtHnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlm</p></div><div id=links><a href=./trevor-lawrence-parents-riding-with-him-from-clemson-to-jacksonville-536694-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Trevor Lawrence Parents Riding With Him From Clemson To Jacksonville</a>
