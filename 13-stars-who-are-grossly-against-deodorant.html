I just don't understand why anyone would do that, but apparently people do and they have various reasons for neglecting what I view to be a pretty essential part of personal hygiene. And I guess if I don't have to smell the outcome, then my opinion doesn't matter. But, it's super weird to think that there are celebrities who refuse to use to deodorant. When I think of famous people, especially the big megastars, I imagine a bunch of self-proclaimed perfectionists with immaculate grooming habits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It just seems weird to skimp on deodorant when everyone is judging your every move. I figured that stars would want to make a good impression on their costars, directors, reporters, and the fans. Much more is at stake when it comes to faulty hygiene if you are a celebrity. So it is just such a weird move. Plus, I feel like having a high profile life is pretty stressful and that stress can lead to some sweat which would result in some gross under arms. Basically, I just find it tough to believe that the pros of not wearing deodorant can actually outweigh the very obvious cons.</p><p>One of the main reasons that celebs forgo the deodorant is because they are really trying to live that green life and want to apply those principles to every aspect of their existence.</p><p>These thirteen celebs refuse to put on deodorant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-cameron-diaz-hasn-t-worn-deodorant-in-20-years><strong>13. Cameron Diaz: Hasn't Worn Deodorant In 20 Years</strong></h2><p>It's so weird to think that someone so beautiful might not smell great because she doesn't use deodorant, but that's actually the case when it comes to <a href=#>Cameron Diaz</a>. The actress said, “I don’t believe in antiperspirant. It’s really bad for you. <a href=#>I haven’t used it for almost 20 years</a>." Oh god, that's such a long time. She justified her actions by saying, “You’re stinky, because you use antiperspirant. It keeps all the stink in.” So how does she suggest keeping sweat and odor at bay? "Let it go and just trim your armpit hair so it doesn’t hold onto the scent.” Well, okay then.</p><p></p><h2 id=12-kourtney-kardashian-doesn-t-want-to-contaminate-breast-milk><strong>12. Kourtney Kardashian: Doesn't Want To Contaminate Breast Milk</strong></h2><p>Anyone who watches Keeping Up With The Kardashians knows that <a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian</a> is all about living that healthy lifestyle. She even mentioned on the show that she doesn't wear deodorant in one episode when<a href=#> Kim</a> was looking for a new brand herself. So why doesn't she wear it? During an episode of Kourtney & Khloe Take Miami, <a href=#>Scott said that</a> "She doesn’t believe in wearing deodorant because she thinks it’s bad for her breastfeeding or something." I don't know if she abides by this habit just when she's breastfeeding or if it is a part of her lifestyle now, but that's some serious commitment to keeping her children healthy. Props to the mom of three.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=11-shailene-woodley-makes-her-own-deodorant><strong>11. Shailene Woodley: Makes Her Own Deodorant</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Shailene Woodley </a>is not like other young Hollywood stars. She has always marched to the beat of her own drum. She has also been very vocal about being an environmentalist and all of her other habits that contribute to her green lifestyle. With that said, I am honestly not at all surprised that <a href=#>Shailene Woodley does not buy deodorant</a>. To be honest, I would be more shocked if she actually did. So how does she carry on without it? Instead she mixes baking soda, coconut oil, arrowroot powder, and essential oil blends to put under her arms. I wonder how that is working out for her....and anyone around her with a nose.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-matthew-mcconaughey-enjoys-his-natural-smell><strong>10. Matthew McConaughey: Enjoys His Natural Smell</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Matthew McConaughey has not worn deodorant</a> in over 20&nbsp;years and I don't know about you, but I'm not really surprised. This just turns out to be one of those cases where you actually can judge a book by its cover. The lack of deodorant totally goes along with the actor's public persona. To make matters worse, he also doesn't wear cologne. But apparently he is super into showering with multiple sessions a day. <a href=#>Matthew</a> explained that everyone is cool with his scent: "The women in my life, including my mother, have all said, ‘Hey, your natural smell smells, one, like a man, and, two, smells like you.'" But why is he so against deodorant in the first place? He does not “like to smell like someone or something else," which is understandable on a certain level....I guess.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-julia-roberts-wearing-deodorant-was-never-her-thing><strong>9. Julia Roberts: Wearing Deodorant Was Never Her Thing</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a> has something special about her that can make anyone open up, so it makes sense that <a href=#>Julia Roberts</a> shared her personal information about living a green lifestyle with the legendary talk show host. When Oprah inquired about the green products that Julia uses for beauty and personal hygiene, the actress said that she <a href=#>doesn't even use deodorant at all</a>: “I don’t actually use deodorant. I don’t like to share that with a lot of people. It’s just never been my thing.” So it really has nothing to do with health or the environment, but Julia Roberts is just not into deodorant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=8-bradley-cooper-believes-the-body-self-cleans><strong>8. Bradley Cooper:&nbsp;Believes The Body Self-Cleans</strong></h2><p>I've always wondered what it would be like to be around <a href=#>Bradley Cooper</a>, but now I'm questioning those thoughts. Why is that? Bradley Cooper has said, "I don't use deodorant really anymore. I do take a lot of showers, so maybe that helps." And why is <a href=#>Bradley Cooper&nbsp;not into applying deodorant</a>? The actor believes that the body self-cleans so I guess that means that deodorant is not necessary in his eyes? Even though the actor avoids deodorant, I just have this feeling that he naturally smells super good, but maybe that's just my inner fan girl hoping for the best.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-kendra-wilkinson-stopped-wearing-deodorant-during-her-second-pregnancy><strong>7. Kendra Wilkinson: Stopped Wearing Deodorant During Her Second Pregnancy</strong></h2><p>I'm not completely sure why Kendra Wilkinson decided to stop wearing deodorant, but during her second pregnancy the reality star claimed that she wanted to be more conscious of what goes in and on her body. And she included deodorant in this. <a href=#>Kendra</a> said, "I’ve also been drinking a lot of water and even trying to go deodorant-free (Hank doesn’t really like that). You can call me a hippie, but for my hair I may not even wash it for a whole week!" She gave no justification for giving up deodorant, but I just feel like sweat and odor are the last thing any pregnant woman needs, but it's good to know that she was looking out for her baby's health with that personal hygiene decision.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-joan-rivers-used-vodka-instead><strong>6. Joan Rivers: Used Vodka Instead</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Joan Rivers</a> always had such high standards when it came to her appearance so I was not expecting to hear that she wasn't into deodorant. Plus I figured she would want to keep her under arm area fresh and sweat-free when she was wearing all of that borrowed designer clothing on the red carpets. So what did she do to keep things cool instead of swiping a deodorant stick? <a href=#>Joan Rivers prevented sweat by using vodka</a>. Yes, you read that right. Maybe alcohol is the answer? I've always thought so, just not for this problem. Was Joan just chugging alcohol to be distracted from her sweat? No. Joan explained her trick: “I always spray my costumes with vodka and water. It’s an old Broadway trick — two-thirds water and one-third vodka, spray your armpits and you’ll never smell again." I wonder if that really works. I'm scared to try it out myself, but I definitely am curious.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-childish-gambino-is-on-some-hippie-shit><strong>5.&nbsp;Childish Gambino: Is On Some "Hippie Shit"</strong></h2><p>Childish Gambino never really provided a reason for it, but the rapper/actor just refuses to wear deodorant. During an interview, he got called out for his unfavorable stench and he said that <a href=#>he never uses deodorant</a> and that he is on some "hippie shit." He never said why he wasn't using deodorant, but he just doesn't and he admitted that his body and clothes do not have a great scent. I feel like this is not a great move for someone like a rapper who moves around on stage while he performs. Hopefully he is over this phase and has started taking care of that smell.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-britney-spears-was-accused-of-being-unkempt><strong>4.&nbsp;Britney Spears: Was Accused Of Being "Unkempt"</strong></h2><p>I hope this is not true. <a href=#>Britney Spears</a> is my queen and I feel like she really has it together these days, especially when it comes to her body and other elements of her appearance. Also the man who alleged that <a href=#>Brit doesn't use deodorant</a> is a former employee named Fernando Flores who was filing a sexual harassment suit against the singer. So I just assume he was saying whatever he could to paint an unfavorable portrait of the pop star. He referred to Britney as "unkempt" and elaborated by saying, "She did not bathe for days on end, did not use deodorant, did not brush her teeth, did not fix her hair, did not wear shoes or socks." I hope this dude is just bitter and thirsty for cash because it would be pretty gross if a woman who dances during multiple concerts a week in Las Vegas decided to skip out on deodorant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-diane-kruger-is-allergic-to-deodorant><strong>3.&nbsp;Diane Kruger: Is Allergic To Deodorant</strong></h2><p>I can't fault <a href=#>Diane Kruger</a> if she does not wear deodorant. It really is not her fault and she makes up for it by overcompensating with the perfume usage. <a href=#>Diane explained</a>, "I wear perfume every day. In the morning, the bottle is right there next to my toothbrush. I’m allergic to deodorant, so I even spritz it on my underarms. That’s probably a little too much information….At the gym then I spritz extra. But, yes, I probably smell bad after a workout….I like to share my imperfections and vulnerabilities. This impossible pursuit of youth and perfection is not for me.” Good for her, I'm sure she's not the only person who is allergic to the active ingredient in deodorant, so sharing her struggle is probably helpful to some of her fans with the same issue.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2-marc-maron-wears-patchouli-instead><strong>2.&nbsp;Marc Maron: Wears Patchouli Instead</strong></h2><p>Marc Maron may be a comedian, but there is really nothing funny about him <a href=#>not wearing deodorant</a>. Doesn't he sweat when he's on the stage during his stand-up routines under the spotlight in front of crowds? I feel like it is not possible for anyone to keep it cool during every single comedic performance. So how does Marc Maron take care of his under arm area? He never really elaborated. Maybe he just prefers to feel natural over there, but he did mention that he wears patchouli. So maybe that masks any gross scents that his body may be emanating during times of stress? I sure hope so.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-leonardo-dicaprio-considers-it-to-be-unnatural><strong>1.&nbsp;Leonardo DiCaprio: Considers It&nbsp;To Be Unnatural</strong></h2><p>It would make total sense to me if <a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a> does not wear deodorant. First off, the dude has been rocking a dad bod for quite some time and is still slaying hot super models so I don't feel like he needs to look after his hygiene or appearance at all to score. Plus, he is all about the environment and is the type to justify not wearing deodorant as an eco-friendly decision. Rumor has it, Erin Heatherton was not feeling his grooming habits. It has been said that he "only showers a couple of days a week to conserve water, and he considers deodorant to be ‘unnatural’.” In all honesty, it really does not matter what Leo looks or smells like, he can still do whatever and whoever he wants.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of these people have valid reasons for avoiding deodorant and then there are others that kind of freak me out. But like I said, it's not my body so it's not my choice. Sure, I honestly think that not using deodorant is gross, but if you are a super rich and famous celebrity, then I guess you can do anything you want and get away with it.</p><p><strong>Sources</strong>: <a href=#>Huffington Post</a>, <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZmprXajBor7SZq6hp12Wv6Z5xqumrKucrnqis8CipaysXZmysLDOq5inrF8%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./movie-actors-who-started-with-tv-commercials.html>&#171;&nbsp;15 Actors Who Got Their Careers Started In Commercials</a>
