His biological parents, former beauty queen, Suzanne Perry and actor, John Bennett Perry divorced when he was one year old. Suzanne is currently married to Dateline NBC correspondent, Keith Morrison.</p><p>The Growing Pains alum has a sister, Maria Perry, from his dad's second and current wife, Debbie Boyle. His four other younger siblings are from his mom's second marriage: Emily Morrison, Caitlin Morrison, Will Morrison, and Madeleine Morrison. Perry had a close bond with all of them.</p><p>In <a href=#>his memoir, Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing</a>, he said that he loved Caitlyn and Emily, "instantly" when they were born. He went on to share that Will and Madeline "never dropped the ball once, any of them, never turned their backs on me, ever." Meanwhile, Maria was the "hub of the Perry family" who "did her best to be wonderfully consoling" when his colon erupted after excessive use of OxyContin in 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Keith also treated Perry as his own son. "He's one of those people who always is the center of the room for a reason and it was so as a kid," the former once said of his stepson. "He's an intense, talented, focused character. He's very bright. That was always the case as he was growing up."</p><p>And despite getting divorced, both John and Suzanne stood by their son's side during his battle with addiction. "They were both standing at the edge of my bed," Perry said of his 2018 hospitalization during an interview with Diane Sawyer in 2022. "I was like, 'Whoa, I must be really sick for this to be happening.'"</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/your-paragraph-text-2023-10-30t103058-248.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The One Actress Matthew Perry Was Devastated He Couldn't Work With During His Final Years In Hollywood</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Matthew Perry’s untimely demise also marks the end of some unfulfilled dreams, including the opportunity to work with an A-list Hollywood actress.</span><h2 id=how-much-did-matthew-perry-get-in-friends-residuals>How Much Did Matthew Perry Get In Friends Residuals?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/your-paragraph-text-2023-10-30t112323-650.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perry, along with his Friends co-stars, <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Lisa Kudrow</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Courteney Cox</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>David Schwimmer</a></strong>, and <strong><a href=#>Matt LeBlanc</a></strong>, each earned $20 million per year in syndication income from Warner Bros. back in 2018. It has since grown after the sitcom was picked up by <strong><a href=#>Netflix</a> </strong>in 2015, giving the studio $1 billion in annual streaming income. The actors then signed a deal that paid them 2% each of that sum.</p><p>Over the years, Perry amassed a total of $120 million net worth but "probably spent $9 million or something trying to get sober," he previously told the New York Times. The 17 Again actor went to rehab 15 times and attended 6,000 Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Inspired by his own journey, he started Perry House, a sober living facility that ran until 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a 2022 interview, he said that <a href=#>it's what he wanted to be remembered for</a>. "I would like to be remembered as somebody who lived well, loved well, was a seeker," Perry said back then. "And his paramount thing is that he wants to help people. That's what I want."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/your-paragraph-text-2023-10-30t103058-248.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The One Celeb That Refused To Star In A Rom-Com With Matthew Perry Despite Getting A Personal Offer From The Actor</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Matthew Perry had a former co-star in mind for a new rom/com, but was instantly rejected.</span><h2 id=matthew-perry-regrets-not-having-kids-to-inherit-his-estate>Matthew Perry Regrets Not Having Kids To Inherit His Estate</h2><h2><img alt="Matthew Perry Regrets Not Having Kids To Inherit His Estate" data-image-id=246285 height=628 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/your-paragraph-text-2023-10-30t103058-248.png width=1200 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></h2><p>Speaking to People ahead of his memoir's release in October 2022, Perry admitted that he had <a href=#>a fear of intimacy that caused him to break up with Julia Roberts</a> and his other ex-girlfriends. "That was me afraid. I manifest something that's wrong with them, and then I break up with them," he told the magazine.</p><p>"But there can't be something wrong with everyone. I'm the common denominator," he continued. "I left first because I thought they were going to annihilate me." He went on to reveal that he'd overcome those issues in May 2021 when he committed to sobriety.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I'm not run by the fear I used to be run by so everything's kind of different. I'm feeling more confident and I'm not afraid of love anymore, so the next girl I go out with better watch out," he quipped. "The thing that's changed about me is I have no interest in hanging out with somebody that I don't know or somebody that I'm not that into."</p><p>He was even looking forward to starting a family of his own. "The next person I really take seriously is somebody that I'm going to be in love with and not be scared by the things that used to scare me," he said, adding that he's excited about becoming a father. "I think I'd be great. I really do. I grew up with a lot of little kids around me, and that's probably why, but I can't wait."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddrLatuIyipaGdop7BbrnArauhnadivaa%2B0bKqZmliZXqutculoKimXZu8s8DUp5xo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./12-shocking-face-tattoos-that-make-us-think-really.html>&#171;&nbsp;12 Shocking Face Tattoos That Make Us Think &amp;quot;Really&amp;quot;?</a>
