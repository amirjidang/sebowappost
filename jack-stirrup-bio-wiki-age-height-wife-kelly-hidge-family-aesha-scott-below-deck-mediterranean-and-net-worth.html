Jack Stirrup Wife</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Speaking of his personal life, the good looking American actor was rumored to have been in a flirtationship with <strong>Aesha Scott</strong>. After a deep search on the internet about the truth of the matter, it’s pretty clear that the two are not together — in any sense.</p><p>According to their social media accounts, the two Below Deck Med castmates have caught the wanderlust bug, but on different sides of the world.</p><p>Aesha’s Instagram profile has shown the free spirit living it up in Monaco and Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Jack has been spotted all throughout Italy and Spain. Jack’s Instagram page is also filled with photos of his current girlfriend called Kelly Hidge.</p><p>Everything about the minute Jack Stirrup asked Aesha Scott to be his sweetheart in the most recent scene of Below Deck Mediterranean was immaculate, from the sheet popping the inquiry to the question mark painted on his chest.</p><p>In any case, Aesha noticed that there was one piece of the recommendation that was not up to extravagance yacht norms.</p><p>Aesha considered the sentimental minute during the Below Deck Mediterranean Season 4 After Show, calling the entire thing “extremely charming” — well, generally. “And after that, he had set up a cheddar platter, set up like the s- – test cheddar platter I’ve at any point seen,” Aesha said. “Favor him, he attempted.”</p><p>What it seems like Aesha didn’t have the foggiest idea, however, is that Jack wasn’t really the one answerable for setting up that cheddar platter. No, it was boss stew Hannah Ferrier who set up everything together for the subsequent stew and deckhand. It didn’t look that awful, on the off chance that you ask us.</p><p>Cheddar platter aside, Aesha was still overwhelmed by what Jack sorted out with the assistance of the remainder of the Sirocco group. “It was charming. Like, I’ve never had a person request that I will be his better half that charming previously,” Aesha said. “Observe, men out there, that is the thing that a lady needs.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jack-stirrup-aesha-scott></span><span>Jack Stirrup Aesha Scott</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-jack-stirrup-still-together-with-aesha-scott></span>Is Jack Stirrup Still Together With Aesha Scott?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Aesha Scott and Jack Stirrup unquestionably weren’t a will-they-or-won’t-they sort of couple in Season 4 of Below Deck Mediterranean. From the minute these two started up a delightful relationship, we had an inclination that things would immediately move toward becoming coy and sentimental between them.</p><p>Also, we were correct! It wasn’t well before the two went out for a stunning supper, moved in together, Aesha acknowledged Jack’s proposition to be his better half, and they at long last carried out the thing.</p><p>Things were as yet hot among Jack and Aesha when this period of Below Deck Med slowed down. They landed the Sirocco together, anxious to check whether their relationship had legs ashore.</p><p>Sadly, Aesha and Jack’s fantasy sentiment didn’t have a cheerful consummation. “No, we split up,” Jack shared a report on their relationship during the Below Deck Mediterranean Season 4 After Show (cut previously). “To be completely forthright, when I returned home, I just idea it was somewhat of a constrained circumstance, and it wasn’t real. I pondered everything and considered it daily.”</p><p>In any case, Aesha has an alternate, all the more grievously definite form of their separation. “We left the vessel, and afterward he resembled, ‘Gracious, I truly need you to come to London with me and meet my family.’ But then he resembles, ‘Don’t book a ticket until I’ve gone to this wedding, since we have family staying, and it’s truly occupied, and I don’t have the foggiest idea what date we’ll have a space for, yet at the same time come,’” Aesha reviewed in the Below Deck Med After Show.</p><p>“And after that the before I know it since I saw that his at that point — I didn’t understand — all of a sudden sweetheart once more was viewing my Instagram Stories.</p><p>So I proceeded to take a gander at her Stories, and I see that she’s on the f- – lord train with him to the wedding and at the wedding with him. What’s more, I was much the same as, ‘Sacred s- – t, how might you be this f- – ruler intends to somebody?’ It was simply such a betray.”</p><p>She said that she at that point called Jack to sever things, he affirmed that he had been seeing his sweetheart while he and Aesha were still attached. “Goodness, I was so stung.</p><p>I was so irritated. Like, outrageously hurt, since I realized that we weren’t going to be anything, you know, since I didn’t need him to be my sweetheart. I realized that we weren’t right. Like, we clicked so well, yet I recently realized that we weren’t right.</p><p>Be that as it may, despite everything we had such a solid kinship,” Aesha revealed to The Daily Dish during a meeting in July. “Thus I was going to do it the grown-up way and go see him in London and in-person resemble, ‘We’re not so much going to do this, isn’t that so? Allows simply be companions.’ He was somewhat thinking something very similar, yet as opposed to being a grown-up about it, he was a defeatist, which he realizes he is. He realizes that he is. Thus rather he just returned home and couldn’t confront it.”</p><p>Both Jack and Aesha affirmed that they haven’t spoken since that telephone call where they separated. “I know through [Travis Michalzik] that he feels super terrible about it and needs to connect and apologize and let me resent him,” Aesha said. “The chick that he’s with is an f- – ruler bitch. She like informed me, resembling, ‘Quit calling my sweetheart.’ I resembled, ‘I’m f- – ruler ringing him to break with him since I don’t have the foggiest idea about what’s happening.’ And so if he’s this powerless, fainthearted sort of fellow — which I adore him, however, he is — on the off chance that you have a lady breathing down your neck resembling, ‘Don’t you f- – lord converse with her or we’re accomplished sort of thing,’ at that point I can see how he cringed to that.”</p><p>Aesha included, “However joke’s going to be on him since she’s going to need to watch us be all sentimental all season. So I don’t believe they’re going to last through the season, to be completely forthright.”</p><p>The subsequent stew explained that she trusts Jack and his better half separated before he joined the Below Deck Med group this season and afterward “got back together rapidly” when he returned home to England. “I wasn’t vexed due to us not being as one; I was simply extremely vexed in light of the fact that we were simply truly such great companions, and I could hardly imagine how a companion could treat another companion like that since he truly treated me like s- – t subsequently,” Aesha revealed to The Daily Dish. “In any case, in spite of that, I would prefer not to be excessively unforgiving on him since I do realize that he has a decent heart. He simply settled on awful choices.”</p><p>Aesha said during the Below Deck Med After Show that she wishes Jack had quite recently stood up to her about reviving his sentiment with his better half. “He doesn’t manage things like grown-ups should manage things; he flees from things. I think he just gets excessively made up for a lost time at the time, and he doesn’t consider the future and the outcomes,” she said. “And afterward he presumably returned home and resembled, ‘Goodness, f- – k, truth is stranger than fiction. I have this other young lady here.’ Like, ‘what have I done’ sort of thing… In the event that he said like, ‘Gracious, we should do nothing.’ But rather than that, he was much the same as ‘I’m simply going to flee from it and cover my head and imagine it hasn’t occurred.’”</p><p>Jack said during the Below Deck Med After Show that he might want to be companions with Aesha again sometime in the future. “I’d like to be, yet clearly it’s a difficult circumstance to be in, isn’t it?” he said.</p><p>Aesha revealed to The Daily Dish that she is additionally staying hopeful about her and Jack’s future fellowship. Be that as it may, she said she needs Jack to assume liability for his activities first. “Better believe it, I trust we can, in light of the fact that clearly, he unquestionably owes me an enormous statement of regret, and I’m going to tear him to pieces on the off chance that we talk.</p><p>In any case, at that point from that point forward, I trust that we can simply put it settled in light of the fact that it wasn’t simply on the show; we truly had such an incredible fellowship.</p><p>I realize he believes that too, so it would be truly cool on the off chance that we could simply put it to harmony,” she shared. “Be that as it may, dislike I harp on it. I never consider it. It wasn’t until Trav considered me a few days ago and resembled, ‘Goodness, he needs to apologize,’ I resembled, ‘Gracious, well, great.’”</p><p>Aesha said in a video in her September 17 Instagram Story that she thought her separation with Jack was “genuinely generally advantageous.” “I need to return home and start my life in New Zealand, he needs to be over in Europe, and he has a mind-blowing majority in London.</p><p>Along these lines, you know, you can’t belong good ways from wicked, actually the opposite side of the world,” she clarified. “So that in itself was sufficient. It wasn’t intended to be.”</p><p>She noticed that proceeding with a sanction season toss ashore is rarely simple. “I think when you’re in yachting, you’re in such an air pocket, and afterward you leave and you get into your reality and you sort of need to consider the coordination of everything,” Aesha said. “It generally changes when you leave a vessel.”</p><p>Despite the fact that Aesha’s association with Jack didn’t end the manner in which she had trusted, the subsequent stew said that she’ll think back on their time together affectionately. “What’s more, don’t stress, additionally, there are definitely no hard emotions there,” she shared. “Only love and great recollections.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jack-stirrup-kelly-hidge></span><span>Jack Stirrup Kelly Hidge</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Is a Baby already and ready?!

I have been so skeptical about showcasing my bump and I to the world; on our little journey; mainly because I didn’t want to be placed into the ‘incapable’ bracket: incapable of still having fun, incapable of doing normal day to day things, and most importantly of being incapable to work,” she wrote. “I have worked so hard to establish myself in this competitive industry, and give 150% into whatever I do, so the anxiety I’ve had over not being booked for a job because of the perception of what being pregnant entails has left me worried, as working really is my happy place and what I will continue to do until I physically have to be bed bound. This may sound ridiculous, and maybe it’s more my thoughts running away with me, but I wanted to air it; as perhaps I’m not the only one who has felt or feels this way.”</p><p>In any case, Kelly stated that she can hardly wait to begin a family with Jack, “So f–k it, here I am ready to take on the world with my growing little human, and amazing boyfriend by my side…who I couldn’t have done it without,” she spouted on Instagram.</p><p>Kelly later thanked her followers for all of their support since she shared her pregnancy news.</p><p>“Thank you for all your lovely messages, I really did read each and every single one,” she shared in a post on October 28 that featured another photo of her gorgeous baby bump. “Isn’t it nice that people you’ve met even just once or twice can say such thoughtful lovely things, along with all the rest of the Insta world who are just good eggs…and [obviously] love to all my main ones.”</p><p>Moreover, Below Deck Med’s João Franco also reacts to Jack Stirrup’s baby news.
