He said that the label had given less to no promotion for his projects and "suppressed his artistry."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"There's a ban on BoB," said the Atlanta rapper on Twitter, adding, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">They boycott me, they are afraid I'll get too much exposure.</a> When ppl say I'm 'under-rated' or 'slept-on' ... it's not entirely the case...

Specifically, he poked fun at B.o.B seeming to think he was being silenced for anything deeper than the absurdity of his comments. "Flat Earth is a problem only when people in charge think that way. No law stops you from regressively basking in it," the scientist tweeted.</p><p>Clearly incensed by the clapback, B.o.B released <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a diss track, "Flatline,"</a> aimed at Tyson. That still wasn't the last he had to say on the matter, though. A year later, he doubled down once again - this time, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a GoFundMe page named "Show BoB the Curve,"</a> aimed at raising money to send satellites into space to get photographic evidence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The campaign has since been removed.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Lana Del Rey's Net Worth Really In The Tens Of Millions After She Got 'Canceled'?</a></span></p><h2 id=b-o-b-39-s-other-controversial-statements><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>B.o.B's Other Controversial Statements</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/b-o-b-3.jpg><p>Flat earth sentiments weren't the only controversial statements made in "Flatline." Seemingly determined to share his thoughts on everything and anything, B.o.B also insinuated that science was a cult. That still wasn't all, though.

As he told DJ Sway Calloway, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">As a musician, you have some real high highs and some real low lows</a>."</p><p>It only made matters worse, then, that while at such a low point, he was also surrounded by people who he believed might not have been the greatest influences - though he didn't go into detail.</p><p>B.o.B explained that his response, which, post-"Flatline," was to disappear, fanned the flames. As he told TMZ, had he issued a statement earlier on, he probably could have mitigated some of the damage.
