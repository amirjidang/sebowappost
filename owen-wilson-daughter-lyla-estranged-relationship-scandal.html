After all, movie stars get seen on massive theater screens that make them look larger than life, they take part in photoshoots, and they appear on red carpets wearing amazing clothes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given everything that is done to make famous actors seem so special, it sure would be great if most of them lived up to that perception of them. In reality, lots of celebrities don't deserve to be put on a pedestal for a variety of different reasons.</p><p>While it is far too common for movie stars to not live up to their fans' expectations, it can be especially disappointing when certain actors fall short. One perfect example of that is it hit a little harder when fans learned Owen Wilson had a daughter he refused to acknowledge.</p><p>Of course, there are lots of <a href=#>stars who have illegitimate children</a> but since Owen has always had such a likable image, that is harder to take from him. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question, did his fans learning about Owen's daughter make them turn on him?</p><h2 id=does-owen-wilson-have-a-relationship-with-his-eldest-children>Does Owen Wilson Have A Relationship With His Eldest Children?</h2><p>From the moment that Owen Wilson's career first started to take off, his personal relationships have played a major role in what fans thought of him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/owen-wilson-signing-autographs.jpg><p>In 1996, Owen rose to fame after starring in the independent movie Bottle Rocket which <a href=#>co-starred his brothers</a> and was directed by <a href=#>his regular collaborator Wes Anderson</a>. On top of his bonds with his siblings and Anderson being in the spotlight, fans also invested in Owen's relationship with Ben Stiller.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Are Ben Stiller And Owen Wilson Really Friends?</a></span></p><p>Since the common perception of Owen is that he builds meaningful and lasting relationships, most people likely would have assumed he'd be a dedicated father. When it comes to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Owen's relationship with his older children</a>, it seems like that was an accurate assumption.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2011, Wilson and his then-girlfriend Jade Duell had a son they named Robert. Over the years, Owen has been photographed with Robert on several occasions. On top of that, Owen has spoken about Robert during several interviews.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/owen-wilson-looking-happy.jpg><p>Shortly after Robert's birth, Owen spoke about becoming a father and thinking about his son's future. "It seems surreal that this tiny human being is now here — and I'm thinking about all the great adventures he has ahead of him."</p><p>During another interview with Parents magazine, Owen revealed that he was an active father.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Changing a flat tire is much harder. I thought changing diapers was going to be challenging, but from the first day, I jumped right into it. I have my whole system down, and I'm able to just knock it out. I sort of surprised myself by being a fairly adept dad."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/owen-wilson-with-a-huge-smile.jpg><p>Once Robert became a little bit older, Owen talked about how fearless his oldest son was during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Similarly, Owen has bragged about Robert's comedic skills as well.</p><p>A couple of years after Robert was born, Owen welcomed another son into the world that he had with Caroline Lindqvist and named Finn. According to sources, Owen was dedicated to Finn before the child was even born since he went to doctor's appointments with Caroline and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/has-owen-wilson-lost-his-fanbase-after-it-came-out-that-he-refuses-to-have-a-relationship-with-his-daughter-lyla_.jpg><p>During Owen's appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, he spoke about how protective his oldest son was of Finn. Owen has also revealed that Finn looks up to Robert so much that his nickname is "Me Too" since he wants to do everything his older brother does.</p><h2 id=owen-wilson-relationship-with-his-estranged-daughter-lyla>Owen Wilson Relationship With His Estranged Daughter Lyla</h2><p>Given that Owen Wilson appears to be a loving parent to both of his sons, it certainly seemed like he should have the same relationship with any other kids he might have. However, when it comes to Owen's daughter Lyla, that isn't the case at all.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is There More To The Story Of Owen Wilson's Daughter?</a></span></p><p>When Lyla turned three years old, her mother and Owen's ex-girlfriend Varunie Vongsvirates spoke to The Daily Mail.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to what Varunie said at that time, Owen completely refused to have anything to do with Lyla at that time and from all indications, that has never changed. Furthermore, Varunie claimed that she has begged Owen to be part of Lyla's life on several occasions, but he completely refuses.</p><p>During the same interview with The Daily Mail, Varunie revealed that Owen supports his daughter financially while insisting "it’s never been about that". On top of that, Varunie brought up the fact that Owen was being cast in father roles at that time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/owen-wilson-paparazzi-photo.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Lyla needs a father. It’s ironic how [Owen] keeps getting these father roles, he's playing a father in his new movie, and he's never met his own daughter."</p><p>Since Owen has never spoken about his daughter publicly, there is no way for fans to know why he has no relationship with her. That said, it seems safe to assume that Owen has a reason since he is a part of his son's lives.</p><h2 id=inside-owen-wilson-39-s-scandal-with-his-daughter-lyla>Inside Owen Wilson's Scandal With His Daughter Lyla</h2><p>At this point in Owen Wilson's career, there is no doubt that he isn't as successful as he was at the height of his career. On top of that, the fact is that many people who supported Owen's career when he was a huge movie star have since learned that he has no relationship with his daughter.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened Between Owen Wilson And Marvel?</a></span></p><p>Given that fans have learned about Owen's daughter and his career isn't what it used to be, it is tempting to assume some causation. If you look at the timeline of Owen's career and the news about his daughter, however, it seems very likely that he didn't lose too many fans because of the revelation about his personal life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On October 11th, 2021, The Daily Mail published an article that revealed Owen had no relationship with his daughter. If that news made Owen lose all his fans, his career should have gone way downhill in 2022.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/owen-wilson-and-tom-hiddleston-in-loki.jpg><p>In reality, 2022 was one of the biggest years in Owen's career. After going several years without starring in any hit films and not appearing in a single movie in 2018, 2019, and 2020, Owen had a lot of success in 2022. After all, Owen starred in Marry Me and joined the MCU as a part of the show Loki in the year 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It also is worth noting that there wasn't any outcry against Owen when he joined the MCU and there is a lot of excitement for Loki's upcoming second season. With that in mind, it seems very hard to claim that Owen's fan following was destroyed by the news of him having a daughter he has no contact with.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGimsJ2eYsSquNKopWackaq0qcDEq2SlsZyWeqa%2F06uYp5%2BVmXqzscuaq6Knnqi1qryMrJqappSWuXA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./heres-how-dr-oz-amassed-his-reported-100-million-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Here's How Dr. Oz Amassed His Reported $100 Million Net Worth</a>
