Despite being a powerhouse in physical challenges, he was voted out after 9 days (in both seasons!) due to being such a social threat to the other players. A real reality TV aficionado, he has already appeared as a houseguest on the popular summer show&nbsp;Big Brother.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michael-yerger-458k-followers>Michael Yerger: 458K Followers</h2><p>Michael Yerger appeared on season 18 of the reality show&nbsp;Survivor: Ghost Island.&nbsp;He was an underdog from the beginning of the season and had to fight to keep himself in the game.
