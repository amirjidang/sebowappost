The likes of the <a href=#>Olsen twins</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Smith</a> made Hollywood worthwhile. Not forgetting the smooth RnB and hip-hop jams that kept fans on their feet busting moves in those bell-bottoms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> 10 Highest Grossing Films of the 90s Ranked</a></span></p><p>While some stars decide to take a health break from the blinding spotlight, others are out there battling personal problems whilst trying to keep up with the fame till it catches up with them. Here’s what these ten long-lost celebrities have been up to since then.</p><h2 id=sin-ad-o-connor><strong>SINÉAD O'CONNOR</strong></h2><p>She was ranked on 100 Greatest Women of Rock N Roll in the world by VH1 in 1995. Her album I Do Not Want What I Haven’t Got earned her international recognition as well as a Grammy award in 1990. She got a lot of attention for tearing the pope's picture on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Saturday Night Live</a>, which she confessed to having no regrets about.</p><p>She has had quite a shaky personal life forcing her to move away from the spotlight. In 2013, O’Connor revealed that she has been battling PTSD due to her abusive childhood history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lindsay-lohan><strong>LINDSAY LOHAN</strong></h2><p>Lohan got her big break in the 1998 Disney remake of The Parent Trap starring a dual role of twin sisters. The movie's success landed her more starring roles in films like Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen and her final starring role in Herbie: Fully Loaded, before transitioning to music in 2007.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Notoriously Difficult Actors Who Have Stormed Off Set</a></span></p><p>Alongside rumors of<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> family problems</a>, she has been arrested severally and charged with drunken driving, cocaine possession, and felony grand theft.&nbsp;Constant brushes with the law and drug addiction problems landed her in and out rehab between 2007 and 2012. She has since kept from the public eye living in Dubai.</p><h2 id=beverly-mitchel><strong>BEVERLY MITCHEL</strong></h2><p>Fans of the famous 10 season television series 7th Heaven must be wondering where Lucy Camden (Beverly Mitchel) went after the show ended in 2007. After her grand engagement with Michael Cameron, she focused more on parenthood with minor roles in films and singing country music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beverly</a>, however, made a small comeback in 2017 with a leading role in Hollywood Darlings that ran from 2017-2018. She has since reverted to blogging on her website, Growing Up Hollywood, and a little bit of acting.</p><h2 id=robert-iler><strong>ROBERT ILER</strong></h2><p>He is best known for his starring role in HBO's Sopranos in his early 20s. Since the show ended, he has not appeared in any major film. It turns out he decided to take a permanent break from the camera and try out something a bit more worthwhile. The actor nowadays plays poker in Las Vegas, and he seems to be quite passionate about it.</p><p>He has gotten to day two in the World Series of Poker and is very intent on playing poker forever. Well, while he's out placing bets on poker tables, his fans are dying to catch a glimpse of him on the screens again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=marques-houston><strong>MARQUES HOUSTON</strong></h2><p>This&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sister, Sister</a>&nbsp;actor's disappearance has a lot to do with the significant transformation he made in his religious life and music career. The Naked singer's transition into a Jehovah's Witness came as a big shock to the fans sparking all sorts of reactions. He's been very open about it, often sharing snaps of his door to door visits.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Most Expensive Religious Buildings Ever</a></span></p><p>Earlier this year, Houston went off the market after he proposed to his teenage girlfriend, Miya. Though he's no longer acting or buzzing our headphones with his sexy jams, he's still working as a producer.</p><h2 id=macaulay-culkin><strong>MACAULAY CULKIN</strong></h2><p>His childhood stardom was marked by his starring role in the '90s film <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Home Alone</a> that earned him a Golden Globe Award. Following the failure of his 3rd film Richie Rich in one year, the 14year old retired from acting to live a normal life. At 18, he used his newly acquired riches from his <a href=#>childhood career</a> to set himself up.</p><p>Getting back into Hollywood is proving to be harder than he thought with all of his comeback films failing. He does enjoy his life away from the spotlight, though, living in Paris.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=coolio><strong>COOLIO</strong></h2><p>Coolio's 1994 album, It Takes a Thief, was among the greatest hits of all time earning the musician a Grammy Award. Coolio took a break from his music career to focus on other business ventures but found it hard to get back to the top upon his return.</p><p>His music just isn't getting the reception it used to get. It seems like he left his fans stuck in the 1990s jams that they just can't accept anything new from him. With all his kids being musicians, there's no way he's retiring from music anytime soon though.</p><h2 id=ricky-martin><strong>RICKY MARTIN</strong></h2><p>After earning his fame in film, he went on to rekindle his music career as a soloist. His 1999 first English-language album, Ricky Martin, blasted the airwaves with the first single "Livin’ la Vida Loca" propelling him to superstardom. In 2010, the same year he came out as gay, he took a break from his music career to focus on his family.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>5 Most Expensive Toys From the 90s</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He is a father of four with his husband, Jwan Yosef. Other than ceremonial appearances and some acting, Ricky Martin is more into humanitarian works, charity, and activism for the LGBT+ community, among other causes.</p><h2 id=andrew-keegan><strong>ANDREW KEEGAN</strong></h2><p>He made his debut into the entertainment industry as a<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> poster child</a> and rose to fame with his recurring role in 7th Heaven. Since his major role in the drama film O, he has been on and off the screens starring on a lot of B-list movies.</p><p>His disappearance in 2014 has a lot to do with his new religion. Keagan became the leader of a spiritual group called Full Circle, with a temple in Venice, California. The organization didn’t last, though, they had to vacate the temple three years later due to funding problems.</p><h2 id=andrea-barber><strong>ANDREA BARBER</strong></h2><p>Here’s another Full Circle, Andrea Barber’s memoir, where she talks of her long battle with anxiety and depression since her days with the Olsens on Full House. It turns out that her personal life was not as colorful as it looked on the screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She took a 20-year break after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Full House</a> ended to focus on nurturing her family before she decided to share her life story on her memoir. She, however, made a comeback on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fuller House </a>in 2016, and from the look of things, the mother of two is faring well.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 90`S Pop Groups Who Are Due For A Comeback</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nk5q5pq7RoquinaNiu6q6xK2gnqtdZoZ6fNJmm6KrkaW9pq3RnptmpJmisq21xqGraA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./best-wwe-royal-rumble-moments-nothing-to-do-with-wrestling.html>&#171;&nbsp;10 Best WWE Royal Rumble Moments (That Had Nothing To Do With Wrestling)</a>
