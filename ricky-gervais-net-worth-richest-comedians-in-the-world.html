While Gervais certainly should be proud of The Office, there is a lot more to his career than that beloved sitcom.</p><p>A comedian who doesn't pull punches, Gervais isn't afraid to <a href=#>call out a talk show host like Jimmy Fallon</a> or <a href=#>debate religion with Stephen Colbert</a>. However, Gervais seems to love making money as a standup comedian the most. Thanks to his fame and success as a comedian, Gervais has become very wealthy, but how does his fortune stack up among his peers?</p><h2 id=ricky-gervais-has-an-incredible-fortune-but-several-comedians-are-richer-than-him>Ricky Gervais Has An Incredible Fortune But Several Comedians Are Richer Than Him</h2><p>From the moment that Ricky Gervais rose to fame, the comedian, actor, and creator has been outspoken. One example of that is the fact that Gervais once went on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a rant against "multi-millionaire" "celebs" who judge healthcare workers</a> who struggle to get by.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ricky-gervais-was-able-to-bank-a-fortune-thanks-to-us-syndication-rights-of-the-office.jpg><p>To Gervais' credit, it turns out that he was speaking out against his own during that rant. After all, according to Celebrity Net Worth, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gervais has a $160 million fortune</a> as of January 2024.</p><p>In 2009, Ricky Gervais was interviewed by Lesley Stahl for a segment that aired on 60 Minutes. During the resulting conversation, Gervais stated that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was "not proud of being rich"</a> .</p><p>Given how wealthy Gervais reportedly is, he would be the richest person by far if he walked into most rooms in the world. However, while Gervais is wealthy, to say the least, that doesn't necessarily mean he is one of the richest comedians in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bill-burr-and-sarah-silverman-s-constant-bickering-resulted-in-one-of-the-cringiest-talk-show-interviews-ever-front-back_commons-licences.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Bill Burr And Sarah Silverman's Constant Bickering Resulted In One Of The Cringiest Talk Show Interviews Ever</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Bill Burr and Sarah Silverman are both comedy greats but their awkward talk show interview together was so unfunny that it was hard to watch.</span><p>On the website Celebrity Net Worth, there are pages dedicated to the majority of the most famous people in the world.

Instead, it could easily be argued that the most fascinating thing is learning how much Gervais makes from the American version of The Office.</p><p>Even though Gervais did barely any direct work on the American version of The Office, it was based on ideas he came up with. Given that Gervais and Stephen Merchant created the original version of The Office, they clearly deserve to cash in on every adaptation. Still, it is amazing to see <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how much Gervais reportedly has made from the American version</a>.</p><p>"Gervais and his co-creator Stephen Merchant have earned tens of millions of dollars during the original run of The Office through various producer and creator credits. Ricky's true windfall has come thanks to extremely lucrative syndication and licensing deals in more recent years. Ricky owns at least 10% of The Office's syndication equity points. In other words, he earns 10% of all profits generated by the show. To date, Ricky Gervais has easily earned north of $100 million before taxes through syndication sales."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipopubrnqosdGvmKKrXaOytXnWqKmtoF2ntqS0xKyrZpuforKltcCnqmahnmLBqbGMsKarpJRk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./dog-the-bounty-hunters-family-meet-his-children-their-mothers.html>&#171;&nbsp;Dog the Bounty Hunters Family: Meet His Children, Their Mothers</a>
