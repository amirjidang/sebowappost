Unsurprisingly, Ford's legendary status has made millions of fans interested in his personal life including <a href=#>what his relationship with his adopted son is like</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2016, Ford's longtime co-star Carrie Fisher revealed <a href=#>they'd had a three-month affair</a> during the making of Star Wars. Given that revelation, many Ford fans wondered if that was a pattern for him and if he got romantically involved with his Indiana Jones co-star Karen Allen. The pair have shared the screen in Raiders of the Lost Ark and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Additionally, Karen Allen briefly reprised her role as Marion Ravenwood in June 2023's Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.</p><p>Here's whether Karen Allen and Harrison Ford were ever romantically involved...</p><h2 id=did-harrison-ford-and-karen-allen-ever-date>Did Harrison Ford And Karen Allen Ever Date?</h2><p>With the release of 2023's Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, fans have gotten the chance to watch Harrison Ford's beloved character on the big screen five times. Between Indiana Jones' five film adventures, the famed archaeologist has experienced several truly incredible things with viewers along for the ride.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/harrison-ford-as-indiana-jones-from-raiders-of-the-lost-ark.jpg><p>On top of watching Jones overcoming a slew of dangerous obstacles, fans have also gotten the chance to see Ford's famous character deal with several different love interests. Between the student with the "Love You" eyelids, Willie Scott, and Dr. Elsa Schneider, several different women have fallen for Jones.</p><p>Still, for most fans of this popular film franchise, only one of Jones' love interests truly was his equal. A truly fantastic character that millions of fans love, it is fitting that Jones wound up marrying Marion Ravenwood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/did-harrison-ford-secretly-date-karen-allen-on-the-set-of-indiana-jones_-here-s-the-truth-about-their-relationship.jpg><p>In three films to date, Karen Allen has done a spectacular job bringing Ravenwood to life partially because the chemistry she shares with Ford is flawless. Given how electric the actors are on camera, it makes sense that fans want to know what their relationship is like in real life.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Harrison Ford Really Didn't Want Chris Pratt To Play Indiana Jones For This Completely Understandable Reason</a></span></p><p>Fortunately for Ford and Allen, it seems abundantly clear that the two actors share an extremely strong bond. That fact is all the more impressive given the fact that Allen revealed she accidentally <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">punched Ford in the face "a couple of times"</a> while filming Raiders of the Lost Ark.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/karen-allen-as-marion-ravenwood-in-raiders-of-the-lost-ark-harrison-ford.jpg><p>In 2021, Allen spoke to Movie Maker's Tim Molloy about the making of Raiders of the Lost Ark. During that interview, Allen revealed that it actually took her and Ford a while to get to know each other as they were both concentrated on making the movie. As Allen revealed, however, she started to become close with Ford after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they bonded over a shared love</a>.</p><p>"We’re both big tennis fans, Harrison and I, and one of the most exceptional Wimbledons, with Björn Borg and John McEnroe, took place. One of the greatest Wimbledons of all time. And we all gathered over at Harrison’s house, and we had this whole day of sitting there watching tennis."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/harrison-ford-and-karen-allen-as-indiana-jones-and-marion-ravenwood-from-raiders-of-the-lost-ark.jpg><p>Since she first worked with Ford, <a href=#>Allen has gone on to have an incredible life and career</a>. Considering everything Allen has achieved, it was fantastic when she spoke to People in 2023 about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how special it has been to work with Ford and Steven Spielberg</a>.</p><p>“What can I say? We have a lot of fun together.” Allen then went on to discuss how Ford has "really grown and matured". "When we first worked together, we were both pretty young, but we've had marriages and children."</p><p>Throughout Ford's career, it has often seemed like he had something in common with his famous Star Wars character Han Solo. Instead of coming across as the guy who would profess his love for people, Ford has often seemed like the kind of person who only remarks "I know" when people say they love him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Billy Dee Williams And Harrison Ford Actually Get Along While Making Star Wars?</a></span></p><p>No matter how grumpy Ford has sometimes seemed in the past, the truth is that he can be very open about the people he cares about. In fact, there are some notable examples of Ford saying how much he adores and respects his past co-stars.</p><p>Similar to when Ford lavished praise on Billy Dee Williams and when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he spoke about how wonderful he thinks Ke Huy Quan is</a>, Ford has made his admiration for Allen clear. When Ford spoke to The Hollywood Reporter, he unreservedly spoke about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how much he respects and appreciates Allen</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/harrison-ford-karen-allen-and-shia-labeouf-looking-happy-together.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Karen is so much fun to work with. She’s wonderfully funny, inventive and talented. She brings energy to the work. She’s not fussy in any way. The character she played was a very brave character, and she had to be brave to do it.”</p><p>Based on everything that Ford and Allen have said about each other, it is obvious they both feel lucky to be a part of each other's lives. That said, there is absolutely no indication from anything the actors have said that they ever dated. On top of that, there have never been any reports claiming that Allen and Ford were a couple. From all indications, Allen and Ford have never been anything other than friends.</p><h2 id=inside-harrison-ford-and-karen-allen-39-s-relationship-history>Inside Harrison Ford And Karen Allen's Relationship History</h2><p>Considering that it seems very clear that Harrison Ford and Karen Allen have never been a couple, that begs an obvious question, who have they been involved with?

Following his first divorce, it wouldn't be too long before Ford tied the knot again.</p><p>In 1983, Ford married the screenwriter Melissa Mathison, and they stayed together for years before their divorce was finalized in 2004. Best remembered for writing the script for one of the most successful films in history, Mathison played a key role in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial becoming a masterpiece. Mathison sadly passed away in 2015 after battling neuroendocrine cancer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since 2010, Ford has been married to Calista Flockhart, and they seem very happy together.
