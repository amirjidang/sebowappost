He was got inspired to play guitar at age 14, after hearing of the death of Jimi Hendrix. There is no information about his family background and how he was raised.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joe-satriani-wife></span>Joe Satriani Wife<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Joe is married to his wife Rubina Satriani for a long time. The pair got married in 1981. Joe is not involved in any kind of love affairs, extramarital affairs or any kind of divorce rumors.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joe-satriani-children></span>Joe Satriani Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The pair has a grown son called&nbsp;Zachariah Satriani.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joe-satriani-education></span>Joe Satriani Education<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He was enrolled to studied music with jazz guitarist Billy Bauer and with reclusive jazz pianist Lennie Tristano. He later began teaching guitar, with his most notable student at the time being fellow Long Island native Steve Vai (both also went to the same high school). While he was teaching Vai, he as well attended Five Towns College for studies in music.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joe-satriani-career-band></span>Joe Satriani Career |&nbsp;Band<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Hej began his career Storming onto the music scene nearly a decade ago, He got recognized as the archetypal post-modern hero. Since his emergence in 1986 with a self-released, self-titled debut album, he later becomes the most recognizable guitar voice of his time, earning his place alongside the great masters of rock guitar. He as well pop-dominated field and accomplishments are even more remarkable: He became successful rock instrumentalist in recent history, selling millions of records and consistently packing concert halls – yet always preserving a strong musical vision, as well as the respect of fellow musicians and forward-thinking music fans worldwide.</p><p>His gift is creating highly evolved instrumental music, using the structure of popular standard songs that allows listeners to latch onto tuneful melodies before being dazzled by his acclaimed musicianship. His hallmarks are a warm, bluesy tone and delicate phrasing, combined with the bursts of the superhuman technical facility which upped the ante well beyond the standards set by generations of great rock musicians before him. He later revisits the familiar sound that demanded the attention of millions of pop fans: “A Train of Angles” creates the joyous pop mood heard in such classic Satriani radio hits as “Summer Song.” On new tunes like “Raspberry Jam Delta-V,” the melodies escalate into passages so stunning, it’s difficult to believe they were performed with just two hands on a single instrument.</p><p>Joe Satriani was born in Westbury, New York, and began playing guitar at age 14. By 1971, he was teaching guitar to others, one of his students being Steve Vai. In 1974, Joe studied with two modern jazz masters, guitarist Billy Bauer and pianist/composer Lennie Tristano; four years later, he moved to Berkeley, California, where he began a 10-year guitar teaching career with students including David Bryson (Counting Crows), Kirk Hammett (Metallica), Larry LaLonde (Primus), and Charlie Hunter, among others. In 1984, Joe released a self-titled five-song EP on his own Rubina label, and the following year completed his first full-length album Not Of This Earth, which was financed on a credit card and released in 1986 on Relativity Records.</p><p>In October 1987, Relativity released Satriani’s second album Surfing With The Alien. The record became a global phenomenon, going platinum with sales of over a million copies in the U.S. alone and landing Satriani’s face on the covers of such magazines like Guitar Player, Musician, Guitar World, and dozens of other international publications. Surfing With The Alien was a landmark release which showcased the guitarist’s stunning array of composing, playing, and producing talents. Consequently and deservedly, it became the most successful instrumental rock record since Jeff Beck’s Wired.</p><p>Each subsequent Satriani release – including Flying In A Blue Dream, The Extremist, Time Machine and the recent Joe Satriani, which was produced by the legendary Glyn Johns – has drawn great commercial and critical attention. The same seems certain to be the case with Crystal Planet, and it’s not just Joe’s fans who have been moved by his unique tone and feel: Players from all walks of musical life have been attracted to Satriani’s work.</p><p>His band at New York’s Bottom Line, Mick Jagger recruited Joe in 1988 as lead guitarist for the singer’s very first tour apart from the Rolling Stones. Deep Purple tapped into Satriani’s mastery when he assumed lead guitar position in the band for its 1994 tours of Europe and Japan. In 1996, the G3 Tour – featuring Joe Satriani, Steve Vai, and Eric Johnson – played 24 dates to some 90,000 fans across North America, a tour documented on the G3 Live In Concert album and home video (both Epic). In 1997, Joe united with jazz guitar great Pat Martino to record two tracks, “Ellipsis” and “Never and After,” for Martino’s acclaimed all-star collection All Sides Now (Blue Note); and enlisted in a second G3 summer tour, this one co-starring Steve Vai, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, and Robert Fripp.</p><p>With its cunning marriage of well-structured songs, challenging sonic surprises, moody moments and breathtaking guitar playing, Crystal Planet has all the marks of a great Joe Satriani disc. After a decade of groundbreaking work, this is one musician still willing to push the edge of conventional rock beyond what’s come before.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joe-satriani-net-worth></span>Joe Satriani Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Joe has an estimated net worth of $12 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joe-satriani-tour-tour-dates></span>Joe Satriani Tour |&nbsp;Tour Dates<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joe-satriani-songs-discography></span>Joe Satriani Songs |&nbsp;Discography<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Not of This Earth (1986)</li><li>Surfing with the Alien (1987)</li><li>Flying in a Blue Dream (1989)</li><li>The Extremist (1992)</li><li>Time Machine (1993)</li><li>Joe Satriani (1995)</li><li>Crystal Planet (1998)</li><li>Engines of Creation (2000)</li><li>Strange Beautiful Music (2002)</li><li>Is There Love in Space?
