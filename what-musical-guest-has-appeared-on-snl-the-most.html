In fact, it is no secret that on some occasions, <a href=#>SNL musical guests haven’t gotten along with the show’s stars</a>. With that in mind, it makes sense that SNL’s producers have welcomed reliable performers back again and again. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question, which SNL musical guests have appeared the most times?</p><h2 id=randy-newman-has-been-the-snl-musical-guest-6-times><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Randy Newman Has Been The SNL Musical Guest 6 Times</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Songwriters Hall of Fame, Randy Newman is known for songs like “Short People”, “You Can Leave Your Hat On”, and “Mama Told Me Not to Come”. One of Saturday Night Live’s earliest musical guests, Newman performed during the show’s second episode. Ultimately, Newman was SNL’s musical guest six times between 1975 and 1988.</p><h2 id=sting-has-been-the-snl-musical-guest-6-times><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Sting Has Been The SNL Musical Guest 6 Times</span></h2><p>After rising to fame as a member of The Police, Sting launched a solo career which allowed him to become even more rich and famous, amazingly enough. A big enough star that he has performed on Saturday Night Live as a musical guest and host, Sting performed both roles during a 1991 episode. In total, Sting was an SNL musical gust six times between 1987 and 1999 on top of the fact that in 1997, he was the host for an episode without performing any music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=coldplay-have-been-the-snl-musical-guest-6-times><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Coldplay Have Been The SNL Musical Guest 6 Times</span></h2><p>An incredibly successful band, it has often seemed like everything Coldplay touches turns to gold. Considered to be among the best-selling music acts of all time, Coldplay has accumulated a long list of accolades over the years. On top of everything else Coldplay has accomplished, they have had the honor of being SNL’s musical guest 6 times between 2001 and 2019.</p><h2 id=beck-has-been-the-snl-musical-guest-7-times><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Beck Has Been The SNL Musical Guest 7 Times</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Beck’s song “Loser” became a surprise hit, there was no way to know that he would go on to enjoy an incredibly unique and successful career. Known for his ability to blend genres and plow his own path, Beck is nearly universally respected in the musical world. Due to his long-lasting career, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beck has performed music on the SNL stage seven times</a> between 1997 and 2014.</p><h2 id=kanye-west-has-been-the-snl-musical-guest-7-times><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Kanye West Has Been The SNL Musical Guest 7 Times</span></h2><p>The last time he was on the show, his behavior was so controversial that <a href=#>Kanye West reportedly is banned from SNL</a>. Despite that, however, there is no doubt that West’s SNL musical performances have largely been praised over the years. With that in mind, it makes sense that West has been the show’s musical guest seven times between 2005 and 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Kanye West's 2016 Backstage Meltdown At 'Saturday Night Live'</a></span></p><h2 id=eminem-have-been-the-snl-musical-guest-7-times><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Eminem Have Been The SNL Musical Guest 7 Times</span></h2><p>According to Forbes, Eminem was the best-selling male music artist of the 2010s and Billboard named him the “Artist of the Decade” between 2000 and 2009. Suffice it to say, Eminem is among the top musical artists of the last twenty years. As a result of all that success, Eminem has been SNL’s musical guest seven times between 1999 and 2017. On top of that, Eminem made a cameo appearance on the show in 2020.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Go Nuts As Eminem Reposts Pete Davidson's 'Stan' Spoof</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-petty-was-the-snl-musical-guest-8-times><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Tom Petty Was The SNL Musical Guest 8 Times</span></h2><p>During Tom Petty’s legendary career, he has released so many hit songs that it would be foolhardy to try to list them all here. That said, some of Petty’s most beloved songs that he has released with and without the Heartbreakers include “Learning to Fly”, “Free Fallin'”, and “I Won't Back Down”. Sadly, Petty went into cardiac arrest due to mixed drug toxicity and lost his life in 2017. Before that, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Petty performed on SNL eight times</a> between 1979 and 2010.</p><h2 id=the-foo-fighters-have-been-the-snl-musical-guest-8-times><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Foo Fighters Have Been The SNL Musical Guest8 Times</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the music world, there are a lot of bands that reportedly are very hard to deal with. On the other end of the spectrum, The Foo Fighters have developed a reputation as a band that is entirely made up of professional and great people. Sadly, in 2022 The Foo Fighters’ much beloved and respected drummer Taylor Hawkins suddenly passed away. Before that, he and the rest of The Foo Fighters performed on SNL eight times between 1995 and 2020.</p><h2 id=paul-simon-has-been-the-snl-musical-guest-12-times><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Paul Simon Has Been The SNL Musical Guest12 Times</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, Paul Simon is the kind of performer who has the innate ability to write infectious music that stands the test of time. Widely considered to be one of the celebrities that are most closely associated with Saturday Night Live, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Simon has appeared on the show a staggering eighteen times</a>. Only the musical guest on twelve of those occasions, Simon performed on the show repeatedly between 1975 and 2018.</p><h2 id=dave-grohl-has-been-the-snl-musical-guest-14-times><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Dave Grohl Has Been The SNL Musical Guest 14 Times</span></h2><p>The only artist to appear on this list twice, Dave Grohl has performed music on the Saturday Night Live stage fourteen times.

On top of that, Grohl headlined The Foo Fighters all eight times they were the SNL musical guest. Finally, Grohl played the drums for Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, as well as Them Crooked Vultures when they all performed n SNL.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Dave Grohl Once Finished A Foo Fighters Concert After Breaking His Leg</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrq2v8icmKVll6qytMCMoZisZZGlvaat0Z6bZqeeYsCvuIytn55lnaTAtXs%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./theylovearii-ariana-renee-biography-age-height-family-life.html>&#171;&nbsp;Theylovearii (Ariana Renee) Biography, Age, Height &amp;amp; Family Life</a>
