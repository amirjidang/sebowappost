Some <a href=#>Victoria's Secret Angels are still wealthy</a> today and that includes Prinsloo. Now, she has a tequila brand called Calirosa. She seems to have put her heart and soul into it.

It was his idea with his wife and they were willing to fund the idea — not just say ‘we’re celebrities, we have an idea, let’s go find someone else’s money to do it,’ which is, I think, a very unique situation for us. I think it shows the belief in the product and puts him in a different category than most celebrities that are involved in brands."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gimpelson continued to Forcebrands.com, "What separates us apart from a lot of celebrity brands is that they are actually putting their money where their mouth is.

Each type has a specific description on the website. The description of Rosa Blanco says, "Calirosa’s standout hue, finish, and flavor are on full display from first look to final sip.

And it's a brand that means a lot to Adam Levine and his wife Behati Prinsloo. As she explained in an interview with Travel and Leisure in 2021, she and her husband love going to Mexico for vacations. She said that they took a trip to celebrate when she turned 30 and they also had their wedding in Mexico.
