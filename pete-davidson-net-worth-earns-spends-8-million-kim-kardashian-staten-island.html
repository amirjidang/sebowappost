The youngest cast member in the 40th season of Saturday Night Live shows no sign of slowing down anytime soon, and rightfully so, he has plenty of upcoming projects on his horizon. To sum it up, here's how Pete Davidson earns and spends his $8 million net worth.</p><h2 id=pete-davidson-on-nbc-39-s-39-saturday-night-live-39><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Pete Davidson On NBC's 'Saturday Night Live'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pete Davidson became the latest comedic force of Saturday Night Live in 2014 at only 20 years old, scoring history as the show's youngest-ever cast member at the time. He reportedly earns somewhere between $15,000 and $25,000 per episode, which can be calculated to an estimated $500,000 a year, if not more. His delivery on taboo subjects and self-deprecating jokes, including his traumatizing experience where he lost his father during the September 11 attack, is what makes him relatable to many. Before that, he got his first televised special on Gotham Comedy Live at the Gotham Comedy Club in New York City.</p><p>"You're surrounded by the funniest people all the time," he said during a recent interview. "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When I'm there, I'm just like, 'Oh, I'm garbage.' </a>You watch Kate (McKinnon) or Chloe (Fineman) or Kenan (Thompson) do a hundred million things, and then my line will be like, 'Hey, everybody!'" ... I know my place."</p><h2 id=he-portrayed-a-villain-in-39-the-suicide-squad-39><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>He Portrayed A Villain In 'The Suicide Squad'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pete joined all-star cast members Margot Robbie, Idris Elba, John Cena, Sylvester Stallone, and more on <strong><a href=#>DC Comics'</a></strong> latest film The Suicide Squad. The standalone sequel to 2016's Suicide Squad sees the group of supervillains teaming up once again against the giant alien starfish Starro the Conqueror. While Pete's on-screen time as Richard (Blackguard), an easily manipulated mercenary, was limited, The Suicide Squad went to become another critical success for Warner Bros despite its "low" box office gross.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Famous Women Are Attracted To Pete Davidson</a></span></p><p>“I love superhero movies, and I’m a huge James Gunn fan,” the actor told Jimmy Fallon. “And I got a call from (The Suicide Squad director) James Gunn. He was like, ‘There’s this role for you in the movie, and you play a guy named Richard Hertz.' ... I was like ‘Dude, that’s the greatest. That’s so awesome.’ And yeah, he was nice enough to let me be in it. And it’s a thing I still can’t believe.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pete-davidson-starred-in-his-semi-autobiographical-drama><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Pete Davidson Starred In His Semi-Autobiographical Drama</span></h2><p>Last year, director Judd Apatow approached Pete Davidson for a personal semi-biographical take on his life, whose father was a firefighter during the 9/11 attack. Pete, then, penned the script and starred in The King of Staten Island, a story about a 24-year-old high school dropout and an aspiring tattoo artist who tries to get his life together, alongside Marissa Tomei, Bill Burr, and more. Unfortunately, The King of Staten Island was a box office bomb for making only $2.2 million out of its $35 million budget, despite its positive reviews from the critics.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-became-a-fashion-icon><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Became A Fashion Icon</span></h2><p>Pete Davidson has recently ventured into the fashion world, in addition to his impressive portfolio in stand-up comedy and acting. The Big Time Adolescence actor was a GQ cover star for the August 2018 issue, in which he talked about his "adventure" of being the youngest cast member of Saturday Night Live. He also took over Calvin Klein's Instagram last December with pal Machine Gun Kelly and starred in ads for Moose Knuckles and Smartwater.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Pete Davidson's Girlfriends: Which One Is The Most Popular On Instagram?</a></span></p><h2 id=he-performed-several-stand-up-specials><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He Performed Several Stand-Up Specials</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to Saturday Night Live, Pete Davidson has also headlined several stand-up specials throughout his career. He made his stand-up special debut, Pete Davidson: SMD, in April 2016 with Comedy Central. Another special, Alive from New York, was released on <strong><a href=#>Netflix </a></strong>in February 2020. He also ventured into voice-acting last year, providing a voice for Phineas T. Phreakers in The Freak Brothers for ten episodes.</p><h2 id=how-pete-davidson-spends-his-money><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>How Pete Davidson Spends His Money</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pete Davidson has loads of money to spend, but what does he like to splurge on? He lives in a $1.2 million Staten Island condo, and given his unique fashion sense, we can assume Pete Davidson drops a pretty penny or two on his closet and accessories. The comedian also partakes in recreational activities, as he was recently caught outside a dispensary. A true romantic, Pete is also known for dropping big bucks on his relationships. According to TMZ, Pete Davidson <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spent nearly $100,000 on his engagement ring to Ariana Grande</a> in 2018, and in 2019, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pete dropped hundreds of dollars on McDonald's after splitting up with Kate Beckinsale</a>.

Things are going so well for Pete Davidson, despite a few bumps along the way (including the 2019 suicide scare and his well-publicized breakup with <strong><a href=#>Ariana Grande,</a></strong> to name a few). Currently, the Staten Island native has a plethora of upcoming projects on his horizon, including a slasher flick (Bodies, Bodies, Bodies) with Amandla Stenberg and a romantic comedy film (Meet Cute) with <strong><a href=#>Kaley Cuoco</a></strong>.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Celebrity Does Pete Davidson Have Fake Teeth?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinnqyVYrGiwsidqqimXaOytXnWqKmtoF2arrO60maqqZ2emcBuhIymoKWkmaS7brfIpmSkmaKZrrS0yJqlZquklsGmuoyiqqWZnpl8</p></div><div id=links><a href=./heres-who-inherited-paul-walkers-estate-and-where-they-are-now.html>&#171;&nbsp;Here's Who Inherited Paul Walker's Estate And Where They Are Now</a>
