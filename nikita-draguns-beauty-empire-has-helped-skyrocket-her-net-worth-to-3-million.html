popular stars on the video-sharing platform, having since branched out and launched businesses outside of social media that is bound to see her make a very profitable income in years to come.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In March 2019, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the very outspoken and sometimes controversial</a> Belgian-American star announced she was set to launch Dragun Beauty, a cosmetics company that was set to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rival the likes of Kylie Cosmetics</a> and Jeffree Star Cosmetics.</p><p>Going off on sales alone, the 24-year-old has made quite a fortune, but should she ever choose to sell her shares similar to how Jenner sold a 51% stake of her brand, Nikita could be looking at an enormous payout.</p><p>Currently, Nikita is reportedly worth $3 million thanks to her growing social media platform, her popular YouTube page, endless endorsement deals, and now she has her booming cosmetics brand to add to her main streams of income, so how else has she managed to gain her wealth at such a rapid speed?</p><h2 id=how-did-nikita-dragun-make-her-money>How Did Nikita Dragun Make Her Money?</h2><p>Nikita started her YouTube channel at the end of 2014. Still, it wouldn’t be until early 2015 when her videos started amassing a significant number in views, as she shared all of her best beauty tips and tricks with her growing amount of subscribers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of her biggest videos include her coming out story, when she told fans that she was, in fact, transgender, adding that she was planning to undergo surgical procedures to attain the body she’s always wanted to have since her teenage years.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Much Does Kim Kardashian Make On Instagram Compared To Filming ‘KUWTK’?</a></span></p><p>Documenting her journey from male to female in a matter of two years was an extraordinary journey to watch, ultimately gaining Nikita hundreds of thousands of new subscribers.</p><p>She started landing partnerships with all kinds of makeup brands, where she fronted everything from lipgloss collections to concealers, hair products, and more.</p><p>But by March 2019, it seemed as if Dragun was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">finally ready to launch her own cosmetics brands</a>, particularly since she was already a beauty YouTube personality, so the decision to create her own company seemed organic. People were definitely eager to see what she would come up with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an official statement made at the time of the announcement, Nikita gushed: “I’ve always been obsessed with the art of transformation.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tristan Thompson Comforting Khloé Kardashian As She Cries ‘Non-Stop’ Over The Ending Of ‘KUWTK’</a></span></p><p>"As an artist, I was more obsessed with how makeup could change your face and that you could be the architect of your own beauty. Transitioning, it was the biggest thing for me to hide male features and make them more feminine and be able to play with my face to be more passable to people.”</p><p>When Dragun Beauty first launched, the socialite decided to start things slowly by testing only a few products on her site, including two complexion products: the DragunFire Skin Perfecting Potion ($25) and the DragunHeart Transformation Face Powder, retailing at a whopping $35.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She also offered fans a more pricey package with the DragunEgg Transformation Kit at $55, while a customized blinked-out version went for as much as $105.</p><p>Then, in October 2019, Nikita <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">released her first makeup palette</a>, which was so popular with fans that it reportedly sold out in the first 24 hours on sale. The palette didn’t come cheap either: it retailed for a whopping $45, and tens of thousands of units were said to have been produced, which would mean she undoubtedly made millions in sales from the palette release.</p><p>Speaking of the success she had with both launches; it seemed evident that Nikita was destined for success as a makeup entrepreneur.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeffree Star’s Ex Boyfriend’s Baby’s Mom Say She’s Been ‘Threatened’ By The YouTuber</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“For me, being a businesswoman and an entrepreneur, it’s really tough,” she says. “I’m blessed to have a lot of women around me, especially on my team, but I’m very forward and know exactly what I want. Maybe I speak too much, maybe I free flow a little too crazy. I know my vision but I still listen to people I take other people’s advice because they’re so knowledgeable.”</p><p>“I truly believe I’m in my own lane and there isn’t anyone doing what I’m doing. I’m not checking off a box, like ‘I’m being&nbsp;LGBTQ&nbsp;inclusive.’ No, bitch. This is me.”</p><p>Meanwhile, it’s believed that Nikita pulls in anywhere from $220,000 to $500,000 in revenue generated from her YouTube channel. At the same time, sponsored posts on her social media platforms, such as Instagram, can easily earn her up to $50,000.</p><p>She also fronted her very own Snapchat series, Nikita Unfiltered, last year, and though it was never revealed how much she was paid for the gig, it's fair to assume she would've made a fortune from that deal too.</p><p>Needless to say, Nikita won’t be going broke anytime soon, that’s for sure.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeffree Star’s Ex BF Admits He Was With Him For ‘The Bag’ As He’s Accused Of Theft</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiloqOZqa5usNGanq6mo2Kvpq3UrbBmnZ2ltrOxjKGYrGWYmrmxscNmqqSxoqSwrLHTZp%2Beql2jsrV51qipraBdqbxuf4ymoKWkmaS7cA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./no-demo-reno-actress-jennifer-todryk-dazzles-fans-with-her-flawless-hair-who-is-she-married-to-369108-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;No Demo Reno Actress Jennifer Todryk Dazzles Fans With Her Flawless Hair- Who Is She Married To?</a>
