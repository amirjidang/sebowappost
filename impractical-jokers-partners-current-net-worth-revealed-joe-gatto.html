It is the longest running and highest rated television series aired on the TruTV channel. After being televised for so many years, the show has gained thousands of fans, many of whom are curious about the guys’ personal lives. Here are the current relationship statuses and net worths of the Impractical Jokers.</p><h2 id=sal-vulcano-has-a-7-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Sal Vulcano Has A $7 Million Net Worth</span></h2><p><a href=#>Sal Vulcano is a stand-up comedian</a> whose claim to fame was with his pals, the Impractical Jokers. He and his friends formed a comedy group called The Tenderloins that toured around the country performing stand-up shows for adoring audiences. Besides that, he has been involved in every Impractical Jokers TV production, raising <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his net worth to $7 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sal-vulcano-might-have-a-secret-wife><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Sal Vulcano Might Have A Secret Wife</span></h2><p>Because of his kind demeanor, Sal quickly became a fan favorite of the Impractical Jokers fellas. While he is incredibly secretive about his personal life, there are rumors that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vulcano had a secret wedding recently</a>, marrying Francesca Muffaletto. There are little details on this relationship, such as when they started dating or what her social media account is, but if the rumors are true, we send our congrats.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These 8 Celebrities Started Out As Stand-Up Comedians</a></span></p><h2 id=brian-quinn-has-a-net-worth-of-7-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Brian Quinn Has A Net Worth Of $7 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brian Quinn has made a name for himself through his usually fearless approach to the tasks his costars give him on the show. He is not only involved in The Tenderloins and the Impractical Jokers productions, but he has also been on a few other projects. Q has starred in two Jay and Silent Bob films, as well as the film Vulgar and a few other animations.

While he may have had fleeting romantic connections throughout the years, he has never been relationally involved with a woman, and continues to be single as of now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=james-murray-also-has-a-7-million-net-worth><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>James Murray Also Has A $7 Million Net Worth</span></h2><p>James Murray is the only joker of the group who has dipped his toe in the art of book writing.

Gatto intends to take this time to focus on his personal life and a solo comedy career, though he holds no ill-will or bad blood with his previous costars.
