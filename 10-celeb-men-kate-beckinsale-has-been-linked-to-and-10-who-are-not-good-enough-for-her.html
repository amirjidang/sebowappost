Educated at The University of Oxford, she got her start in the film,&nbsp;MuchAdo About Nothing,&nbsp;while she was still at Oxford. She has an effortless charm about her. Kate has said about her passion for acting, “I grew up immersed in film. My family were in the business. I quickly realised that my parents seemed to have much more fun in their work than any of my friends' parents."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like many actors, Kate manages to keep her slate of acting jobs full, thanks to both her talents and her approachable nature. People want to work with her, cast her, and watch her.</p><p>While her acting chops have led viewers to believe in the chemistry between Beckinsale and her leading men, only a select few become her significant others. Despite being in the spotlight for nearly three decades, Beckinsale has remained picky about who she lets into her heart, with only a handful of gentleman suitors making the cut over the years.</p><p>Here are 10 celebrity men who have been linked to Kate Beckinsale, and 10 who aren’t good enough for her (both on and off-screen).</p><h2 id=linked-michael-sheen><span class=item-num>20 </span><span>Linked: Michael Sheen</span></h2><p>This relationship has stood the test of time, in one way or another. After they were cast in a play together in 1995, Sheen and Beckinsale began dating. In 1999, they welcomed their daughter, Lily. Despite breaking up in 2003, the pair remain great friends who have co-parented together every step of the way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=not-good-enough-john-mayer><span class=item-num>19 </span><span>Not Good Enough: John Mayer</span></h2><p>John Mayer’s player attitude has followed him everywhere he goes. He’s even sick of his reputation. Just the same, someone like Beckinsale would stay clear of the singer, just in case. Mayer has said: “Sometimes I feel like people need to update their internal Wikipedia on me… Come to 2018 (and beyond), where my No.1 girl is my therapist.”</p><h2 id=linked-len-wiseman><span class=item-num>18 </span><span>Linked: Len Wiseman</span></h2><p>Just like the Underworld franchise has been a big part of Beckinsale’s life, so have the people who worked with her on it. She began dating Underworld Director, Len Wiseman, in 2003. They wed in 2004 and were married for over 10 years, before finally separating in 2015.</p><p>People Magazine reported that a source close to the pair said, "They are still friendly and spend time together in LA when Kate is there. There has been no drama.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=not-good-enough-christian-bale><span class=item-num>17 </span><span>Not Good Enough: Christian Bale</span></h2><p>Christian Bale has an intensity that he brings to his Method acting, that most people would have trouble dealing with during a romantic relationship. While there is no doubt that he’s talented, we’re guessing that Beckinsale would have no time for his drama or notorious on and off-set tantrums.</p><h2 id=linked-jack-whitehall><span class=item-num>16 </span><span>Linked: Jack Whitehall</span></h2><p>It seems, following her break-up with her long-term husband, that Kate wanted to have fun with some youthful men who would be good company. In November of 2018, she was spotted displaying some serious PDA with British comedian and actor, Jack Whitehall. According to E! News, “She runs in the same social circle as Jack and has always thought he was gorgeous and funny.”</p><p>The same source added, “Kate likes dating younger guys and having fun with it. She's very youthful and young at heart so it works for her. It's easy and less pressure dating someone young who isn't looking for a serious commitment."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=not-good-enough-tobey-maguire><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Not Good Enough: Tobey Maguire</span></h2><p>Since Kate Beckinsale likes to maintain long-term friendships with her exes, anyone who doesn’t fall into the nice guy territory isn’t worth dating. Word on the street (and rumors spread by casting agents) say Tobey is, “the worst little monster you’ve ever met.” He’s been rumored to order people not to look him in the eyes on the set and apparently has insisted that people call him Tugboat Tobey. Weird.</p><h2 id=linked-pete-davidson><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Linked: Pete Davidson</span></h2><p>It wasn’t a long relationship, but Beckinsale clearly likes people who can make her laugh. This is probably why she was spotted leaving the 2019 Netflix Golden Globe party with SNL star, Pete Davidson. For several months, they were seen at hockey games and out and about, holding hands. They ended the relationship after about three months.</p><h2 id=not-good-enough-leo-dicaprio><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Not Good Enough: Leo DiCaprio</span></h2><p>There have been numerous articles shaming Leo for dating only women 25 and younger. Since Kate is well above the age of 25, odds are she wouldn’t waste her time pursuing a relationship with someone who doesn’t appreciate the experience of an older, mature, and smoking hot woman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=linked-matt-rife><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Linked: Matt Rife</span></h2><p>It was two years after her divorce from Wiseman before Beckinsale got back into the dating game. In June 2017, she began a relationship with comedian, Matt Rife, a good-looking funny man who is 22 years younger than the British babe.</p><p>A source told People Magazine, "She has been seeing Matt for the past few weeks. She really seems to like him. She refers to him as an old soul. There is obviously a physical attraction, too. The age difference doesn’t matter to her. Matt is amazing to her."</p><h2 id=not-good-enough-jared-leto><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Not Good Enough: Jared Leto</span></h2><p>Jared Leto is a lot of things, but funny just isn’t one of them. With all the comedians and actors (known for their nice guy personas) that she’s been connected with, Leto just wouldn’t be her cup of tea.</p><p>Whether his arrogance and pompous attitude is just an act or part of the whole pseudo-rock star thing, we just don’t see these two ever making a romantic (or even friendship) connection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=linked-scott-speedman><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Linked: Scott Speedman</span></h2><p>The on-screen chemistry between Scott Speedman and Kate Beckinsale in the Underworld franchise is scorching hot. While the two of them have never been romantically linked in real life, there is definitely electricity in the air whenever they share a scene. They obviously get along well enough in real life, as they decided to continue to work with each other on the franchise sequels.</p><h2 id=not-good-enough-scott-foley><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Not Good Enough: Scott Foley</span></h2><p>While Ben (Scott Speedman) and Noel (Scott Foley) were enough to keep the interest of Keri Russell (Felicity) on the hit show geared towards teens and young women, something tells us that his charms ended when people graduated from college. Perhaps it’s the rumors that many cast and crew members aren’t fans of the star which led us to believe think he wouldn’t be the right choice for Felicity or Beckinsale.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=linked-john-cusack><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Linked: John Cusack</span></h2><p>One romantic movie, that is sometimes considered a Christmas film, features star-crossed lovers who rely on fate to bring them back together. Serendipity brings Beckinsale and Cusack together in a sweet and entertaining way.</p><p>Romantics and cynics alike can appreciate the on-screen heat between the two, even though the time they share on-screen together is quite limited – because the point of the movie is them looking for each other!</p><h2 id=not-good-enough-jeremy-piven><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Not Good Enough: Jeremy Piven</span></h2><p>Always a supporting man and never the romantic lead, there is no way character actor Jeremy Piven is going to get the girl...when the girl is Kate Beckinsale. Despite reuniting to lead the announcements for the 2014 Golden Globes, it’s immediately apparent that things are completely platonic between the duo.</p><h2 id=linked-josh-hartnett><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Linked: Josh Hartnett</span></h2><p>Remember Pearl Harbor? Back when Josh Hartnett was still a household name, thanks to his floppy brown hair and boyish charms, he lit up the screen with Kate Beckinsale, in the 2001 romantic war drama,&nbsp;Pearl Harbor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Watch it again if you want to reminisce about the early 2000s...and decide whether the movie was bad enough to earn the six Golden Raspberry Award nominations it received.</p><h2 id=not-good-enough-adam-levine><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Not Good Enough: Adam Levine</span></h2><p>When enough people start saying bad things about someone famous, people begin to think it must be true. It’s been reported that the arrogant Adam Levine won’t even sign autographs for women he deems ugly. We’re guessing this rudeness puts Kate Beckinsale, and virtually every other nice person, out of his league.</p><h2 id=linked-ben-affleck><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Linked: Ben Affleck</span></h2><p>Despite being romantically linked in the film,&nbsp;Pearl Harbor, the chemistry between Beckinsale and Affleck doesn’t cut the mustard. Yes, we believe that they could have been romantically tied for a short time, but the connection with Josh Hartnett is just so juicy. Even though Affleck played the patsy, the movie made a lot at the box office. Maybe next time, Batman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=not-good-enough-brad-pitt><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Not Good Enough: Brad Pitt</span></h2><p>No one will ever let Brad Pitt forget that he fell in love with someone else and possibly cheated on TV sweetheart, Jennifer Aniston, with his now ex-wife, Angelina Jolie. At this point in time, Beckinsale doesn’t seem like she’d want the baggage that would be associated with Mr. Pitt.</p><h2 id=linked-john-corbett><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Linked: John Corbett</span></h2><p>Serendipity is one of the few films or TV shows from the late 1990s and early 2000s where people aren’t falling all over John Corbett. People screamed at their TVs when Carrie treated Aidan badly and everyone wanted to move to Alaska when Chris in the Morning starred on Northern Exposure.</p><p>Just the same, Corbett played a believable and nice (albeit self-centered) musician and obstacle in 2001’s Serendipity.</p><h2 id=not-good-enough-jude-law><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Not Good&nbsp;Enough: Jude Law</span></h2><p>Jude Law made more news in 2005 for his love triangle with Sienna Miller and their kids’ nanny. Law has managed to keep his career going...and even take himself a little less seriously.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Sienna and Jude got back together in 2009, she got even by cheating on him with James Bond star, Daniel Craig. Even though they both have a UK connection, Beckinsale would probably prefer to keep all her relationship drama on-screen, and not in real life.</p><p>Sources: People, Wonderwall, E!
