Some think he's a hero, some think he's a slimeball, and others are just harmlessly fascinated by it.</p><p>Well, the saga continues with Pete's latest alleged romantic fling; his Bodies, Bodies, Bodies co-star, Chase Sui Wonders. If Chase looks familiar, it's certainly because of her role in HBO Max's Generation as well as the fact that she dated another TV hottie, Riverdale's Charles Melton.</p><h2 id=who-has-chase-sui-wonders-dated>Who Has Chase Sui Wonders Dated?</h2><p>Harvard graduate Chase Sui Wonders first started her career making and starring in her own work. But soon she was discovered by a variety of filmmakers, including Sofia Coppola. However, it was HBO Max's Generation that really put her on the map due to feature her in one of the main roles. Since then, she has been cast in a number of notable projects and doesn't seem to stop working.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chase-sui-wonders-movie-premiere.jpg><p>However, since Chase Sui Wonders is still at the beginning of her career, not a lot is known about her relationship history. There's no doubt she has had a couple of boyfriends, but the only famous one appears to be Riverdale's Charles Melton.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/chase-sui-wonders-boyfriend-charles-melton.jpg><p>Of course, Charles Melton was famous for dating his Riverdale co-star, Camila Mendes. But the pair confirmed that they amicably split in December 2019. That's despite rumors that they had a bit of an on-and-off again thing in the years following. But both Charles and Camila have moved on with their lives by 2023.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Adam Levine And Pete Davidson Have Caused Endless Controversy Over Their Tattoos</a></span></p><p>Fans were initially excited when <a href=#>Charles Melton and Chase Sui Wonders confirmed their romance</a>. While they were first linked in January 2022, it took until July for them to publicly address it, according to J-14. Since then, the pair have posted numerous PDA-filled images together, including of them on vacation with Charles's Riverdale co-star KJ Apa and his wife.

So much so that it's pretty safe to come right out and say that they have broken up. Not only have they not posted anything about each other for a few months, but, at the time of this writing, they don't even follow each other on Instagram. Oh, and then there's the fact that Chase has seemingly cozied up with every man's worst nightmare... Pete Davidson...</p><h2 id=is-pete-davidson-dating-chase-sui-wonders>Is Pete Davidson Dating Chase Sui Wonders?</h2><p>At the time of this writing, we can't be 100% sure if Pete Davidson is dating his Bodies, Bodies, Bodies co-star, Chase Sui Wonders. However, they have been spotted together on a number of occasions. And they've looked increasingly more comfortable with each other.

And it's assumed that Pete and Chase first became close on the set due to playing boyfriend and girlfriend.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/kim-kardashian-made-pete-davidson-s-lifestyle-ten-times-more-over-the-top-but-did-he-actually-pay-for-anything_.jpg><p>Bodies, Bodies, Bodies premiered at South By Southwest in March 2022 and went wide in August.

They sat on the same side of the table and Chase even had her arms wrapped around the sought-after ladies' man.</p><p>A source close to Pete stated told People that he was spending a lot of time with Chase for fun but it's not supposed to be a long-term thing.
