Though the latter struggled with criticism over his performance as Will Turner, he had fun playing the "straight guy" to the former's iconic character, Jack Sparrow. "Nobody steps out of the door or onto a set – whoever you are, whether you're an actor, director or producer – nobody is trying to do bad work," Bloom told The Hollywood Reporter of that time. "I know when I put my head down at night, I've done my best with everything that I've ever done. I've always given it my all, and I think in a way, if anything, there was a lot of safe play in my career."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I'm not really interested in that any more, so I can see how... I mean for Will, for example, I was playing the straight guy to Johnny's remarkable Jack Sparrow, but it's not easy to pull that straight guy off, do you know what I mean?" the Lord of the Rings star continued. "In a way, it was the emotional thread, that relationship between Elizabeth [Swann, played by Kiera Knightley] and Will, but I don't look back with anything. I just look forward with excitement, to be honest now."</p><p>In another interview with BBC, he confessed that Depp is one of his heroes. "It was just the most fun I've ever had," Bloom said of working with the Edward Scissorhands star in 2003's The Curse of the Black Pearl. "I got to work with one of my heroes, Johnny Depp, and to see how he goes about business, which was really inspiring for me at this stage in my career." He also raved about Depp's dedication to his craft. "I knew he'd bring something unique to it the way he always does with his roles. I just didn't know what it would be when I saw it, it was fantastic," he added. "For me, as a young actor, to see somebody like Johnny who creates a character from nothing, it's great."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Are Orlando Bloom's Famous Ex-Girlfriends</a></span></p><p>There was also a time when Depp flew them together with Pirates' director, Jerry Bruckheimer in his private jet. They were set to meet a Caribbean Prime Minister, Keith Mitchell, and things got a little crazy before they did. "Jerry was up at the front of the plane with his wife, and me and Johnny and Johnny's friend Sam were at the back of the plane and we sat there and drank red wine," Bloom recalled. "I don't know, maybe the altitude had something to do with it, but when we got to the island we just, like, crawled off the plane, staggering."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The Prime Minister was there to meet us and he goes, 'Hey man, very pleased to introduce you to St. Vincent,'" the actor continued. "Johnny's friend crawled past him, didn't even stop, Johnny gave him a huge hug and kept kissing him. And there's me trailing after Johnny picking up all the stuff he kept dropping. It was crazy." The two are that close, that one time, Bloom played Depp on an episode of Ricky Gervais' Extras. In the skit, he said that while on the set of Pirates, Depp was ignored by "the birds" that walked right past him to find Bloom instead. "Ooo, look at me, I make arthouse movies. Ooo, I’ve got scissors for hands," Bloom said, trolling his friend.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What James Franco Has To Do With The Johnny Depp And Amber Heard Trial</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-orlando-bloom-thinks-of-johnny-depp-39-s-amber-heard-scandal>What Orlando Bloom Thinks Of Johnny Depp's Amber Heard Scandal</h2><p>In 2017, amid the release of Pirates' fifth installment, Depp was heavily scrutinized over his scandal with Heard. But Bloom expressed compassion for the actor during the promotional tour. "The man that I know and love is the man who's here tonight, and he's like on form and does everything the right way," he told People at the time. "You know, people go through all kinds of weird stuff in the world and it's just a shame that it has to be dragged out in public. Because, God knows he's been one of the most private and stand-up people I've ever met."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Why Did Katy Perry And Orlando Bloom Break Up?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6q7vHp6WyZZSavbF5zqujmqaUpHqjuM6opKxllqe2prrDrJ%2BiqF8%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./does-actress-regina-hall-have-a-sister-update-about-her-three-brothers-and-siblings-2.html>&#171;&nbsp;Does Actress Regina Hall Have A Sister?
