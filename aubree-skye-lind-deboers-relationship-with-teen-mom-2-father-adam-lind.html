Chelsea was only 18 years old at the time and dating her now ex Adam Lind. While Chelsea has shared over the years that things were less than perfect between Aubree Sky Lind-DeBoer and Adam Lind, what is their relationship like now?</p><h2 id=does-aubree-sky-lind-deboer-get-along-with-her-father-adam-lind>Does Aubree Sky Lind-DeBoer Get Along With Her Father Adam Lind?</h2><p><a href=#>Chelsea DeBoer left Teen Mom 2</a> because she wanted to make sure that Aubree Sky Lind-DeBoer would be happy. But while Chelsea has always been a caring and devoted parent, the same thing can't be said of Adam Lind. Fans of the Teen Mom franchise know that there have been some really tough relationships on these MTV shows. And Chelsea went through a lot with Adam.</p><p>In 2022, Chelsea DeBoer spoke on Instagram Live about whether Aubree Sky Lind-DeBoer saw her father Adam Lind. Chelsea suggested that she hadn't been in touch with him for a while and that she didn't know much about what was happening in his life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/adam-lind.jpg><p>According to In Touch Weekly, Chelsea said, “I think he’s doing pretty good. I don’t know because I don’t speak to him personally, but I have heard some good things, that he’s in a good place.”</p><p>In February 2023, Chelsea said something a bit more positive about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aubree's relationship with Adam</a>. She explained to Us Weekly, “There’s no bad vibes and it’s just a very open relationship. There’s no bad feelings. We see him sometimes and it’s totally fine.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/aubree-skye-lind-deboer-chelsea-deboer.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It sounds like the relationship is better than it once was. However, the fact that Chelsea said that she and Aubree get together with Adam "sometimes" suggests that they don't spend time with him regularly.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>There's One Thing Fans Say Doesn't Add Up About Chelsea Houska's Time On MTV's Teen Mom</a></span></p><p>Teen Mom 2 fans definitely remember how hard Chelsea and Adam's relationship was and how things got bad after she gave birth to Aubree. In season 3, the couple was still together, although they had broken up before and then reunited. Aubree was three years old at the time.</p><p>According to Us Weekly, in one Teen Mom 2 scene, Adam and Chelsea took Aubree to a restaurant, and when she was unhappy, he laughed instead of figuring out how to solve the problem.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/aubree-skye-lind-deboer.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chelsea talked about her relationship with Adam</a> in an interview with Radar Online back in 2011. At the time, she sounded hopeful that she and Adam would be able to work things out. She said, "It’s no secret that we have had our ups and downs, but we are doing our best to work through it. I think it’s been more difficult for him to give up being young and care free than it was for me, which is how it is for a lot of young fathers from what I've seen. I believe we are both still learning about life and being new parents like most people are with their first child. It’s a growing and learning experience."</p><p>That didn't end up happening. And in 2014, Chelsea and her now husband Cole DeBoer started their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the past few years, Adam Lind has a few photos of Aubree Sky-Lind DeBoer on his Instagram account. This suggests that she has been in his life at some point.</p><p>However, Chelsea and Adam's relationship has never been smooth. In 2017, news came out of Adam's arrest for "violation of conditional bond no contact in domestic arrest," according to E! News. The publication reported that this was because of a situation with Adam's ex Stasia Huber. In October 2022, Lind was arrested because he didn't pay child support, according to The Hollywood Gossip.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Viewers Say 'Teen Mom' Cheyenne Had This In Common With Chelsea Houska</a></span></p><p>Teen Mom, Teen Mom 2, and Teen Mom OG all have some sad scenes that prove how tough it is to be a young mother.

And as Chelsea saw her daughter grow up, she didn't want people to hear them talk about the situation, which is understandable. Chelsea explained to E! News in 2021, "When she was little, the stuff that was going on with her dad and stuff, it was from my point of view, and as she got older, it started coming from her point of view. I think that deserves to be private for her."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But now that Adam and Aubree seem to see each other more often than they once did, it's possible that things are happier between the father and daughter.</p><h2 id=what-is-teen-mom-2-star-adam-lind-doing-now>What Is Teen Mom 2 Star Adam Lind Doing Now?</h2><p>Teen Mom 2 fans are curious about what Adam Lind's life has looked like in the years since he appeared on the MTV reality series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/adam-lind-teen-mom-2.jpg><p>In 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Lind had a construction job</a>, according to The Sun.

I have no clue where he's at or what he’s doing.”</p><p>While Adam maintained his Instagram account for a while, his last post is from November 2016.
