One of those was a rivalry with Andrade El Idolo, which started when Andrade thought Allin was a child.</p><p>This was a bizarre and poor way to kick-start a feud between two tremendous performers, and it led to their feud being simply average, with Andrade attempting to employ Allin at times too. It just didn’t work and is among Allin’s most boring feuds.</p><h2 id=best-debut-vs-cody-rhodes><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Best: Debut Vs Cody Rhodes</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Darby-Allin-vs-Cody-AEW-Fyter-Fest.jpg><p>Darby Allin made his debut on AEW’s second ever show - Fyter Fest.

AEW decided to have him lose in a six-man tag on the next show, though it was understandable given his opponents included MJF.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, his loss in his next match was inexcusable. Allin was on the losing end of a triple threat Cracker Barrel match with Jimmy Havoc coming out on top. Havoc clearly wasn’t in AEW’s major plans, so to have him win made no sense at all.</p><h2 id=best-sting-rsquo-s-debut><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Best: Sting’s Debut</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AEW-Sting-Debut-Darby-Allin-Cody.jpg><p>Although Sting’s AEW debut was more about the legend himself, Darby Allin was made to look like a huge deal. Sting came to the aid of a group of babyfaces, before staring down those that were left in the ring. He walked past Arn Anderson, Dustin Rhodes, and Cody Rhodes, before reaching Allin.</p><p>Sting and Allin’s face-off was the most significant of the segment, with Sting lingering on the younger star for the longest time. That alone made this segment about Allin too, and his involvement here will ensure that he remains a significant part of Sting’s history.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=worst-speaking-out><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Worst: Speaking Out</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/darby-allin-looking-wild-aew.jpg><p>During the pandemic, many brave individuals spoke up against alleged abusers within the professional wrestling industry in the Speaking Out Movement. One of the names mentioned was Darby Allin, which threw his name into some bad press.</p><p>It didn’t affect his position as such in AEW, but when looking online there are some in AEW comments sections which don’t forget the fact that his name was brought up. <a href=#>He would also get called out on Twitter by Cora Jade</a> in an interaction which made him delete a tweet.</p><h2 id=best-winning-tnt-championship><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Best: Winning TNT Championship</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Darby-Allin-TNT-Championship-AEW.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After multiple attempts, Darby Allin finally overcame Cody Rhodes at the Full Gear 2020 PPV, <a href=#>with him winning the TNT Championship in what is still arguably his best moment in the company</a>.
