It’s rare that someone can stand out among all the glitz and glamour of showbiz. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Megan Fox</a> has managed to be the most beautiful person in an industry that’s filled with them. She is often regarded as the most beautiful celebrity of her era and will likely go down in history as one of the most beautiful ever. Her fashion sense and style influenced an entire generation. She has starred in big-budget blockbusters and appeared on the covers of all the top magazines. She is also known for her rebellious and feisty attitude.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Megan Fox is often praised for her beauty and killer body. However, she openly admits that it takes a great deal of intense work to stay in the kind of shape she’s in. She is known for taking her workouts very seriously. She works closely with her personal trainer, Harley Pasternak. Harley works with all the big-name celebrities but Fox is one of his most famous. Her personal trainer knows all the secrets and tips that it takes for Fox to stay in stellar physical fitness. Here is a look at 20 Things Only Megan Fox’s Personal Trainer Can Tell Us About Her Lifestyle.</p><h2 id=megan-and-her-trainer><strong>Megan And Her Trainer</strong></h2><p>Megan Fox is known for her dedication to training and a proper diet. However, she doesn’t do it alone and has the help of one of the best personal trainers in Hollywood, Harley Pasternak. Harley has worked with all the biggest stars in the business. He’s worked with numerous celebrity clients, including&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanye West</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lady Gaga</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian</a>. Early in his career, he worked closely with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Halle Berry</a> for her role in Catwoman. He also worked closely with Fox during several films (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, in particular)&nbsp;where he makes a cameo. When working out with Megan, they often isolate certain muscle groups.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Harley noted, “Each day of the week she would come in and we’d do different body parts.”</strong></p><p>Judging by her movie roles, this workout is certainly getting the job done.</p><h2 id=5-factor-workout><strong>5-Factor Workout</strong></h2><p>In 2004, Megan Fox made her feature film debut in Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, which also starred <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsay Lohan</a>. The film received mostly negative reviews but it put Fox in the spotlight and brought her several major opportunities. It was just the beginning of her film career and the start of her intense physical training. She’s been training with Harley for years to get in shape for all of her major roles. Harley has a special workout known as the 5-Factor workout.</p><p><strong>The workout involves 5 easy circuits a day with each round lasting 5 minutes.</strong></p><p>Harley noted, “We do 20 repetitions on each upper body, lower body, and abs and cycle through those three exercises nonstop, repeating the circuit four times.” It’s easy to see that her intense training is paying off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-factor-healthy-eating><strong>5-Factor&nbsp;(Healthy Eating)</strong></h2><p>Megan has always had a very good and healthy diet that contributes to her lifestyle. Additionally, Megan ensures that her husband, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brian Austin Green</a>, and her children eat right. Both before and after giving birth, she has stuck to Harley’s 5-Factor diet. She sticks to 5 meals a day and goes for low-fat source of protein, healthy carbohydrates, healthy fats, and smoothies. Harley notes that it’s important to exercise and have a good diet in order to lose post-baby weight. According to Harley,</p><p><strong>“Megan and Brain eat really well. They both cook and love using their blender. They love my smoothie recipes!”</strong></p><p>His advice is great for women trying to lose the post-baby weight but is also great advice for anyone hitting the gym and looking for a healthy diet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pregnancy-workout><strong>Pregnancy Workout</strong></h2><p>In 2001, Megan Fox appeared in the family adventure film, Holiday in the Sun, which starred <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mary-Kate</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashley Olsen</a>. Later, she landed minor roles on Two and a Half Men, What I Hate About You, and was an extra in Bad Boys II. She would soon become one of the most in-demand celebs in Hollywood. However, in the last several years, her family has become her main focus.</p><p><strong>Despite being pregnant three times, she never let it stop her from working out and eating healthy.</strong></p><p>Harley noted, “We used the exact same exercises as we did pre-baby. We just focused more on the process and adjusted our program to suit her specific needs and limitations.” Harley has made similar workout routines for several other famous pregnant celebrity moms.</p><h2 id=pregnancy-workout-ii><strong>Pregnancy Workout II</strong></h2><p>From September of 2004 to May of 2006, Megan portrayed Sydney Shanowski on the sitcom Hope & Faith, which starred <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelly Ripa</a> and Faith Ford. She met Brian Austin Green on the set of the series. They soon began dating despite their age difference and eventually married in 2010. They have three children together, and during each pregnancy, she stayed in shape. Her workouts included weights, cardio, pilates, and yoga.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>She managed to stay in such good shape that it helped with the birth.</strong></p><p>Harley noted, “As she progressed from trimester to trimester, we’d modify things. As a result, she was so fit at the point of delivery that it actually went more easily and she was able to get medical clearance relatively quickly to come back and keep working out.”</p><h2 id=megan-s-body><strong>Megan’s Body</strong></h2><p>In 2009, Megan starred in the black comedy-horror film Jennifer’s Body, which also starred <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amanda Seyfried</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Brody</a>. She showed off her insanely fit body proving the hard work that she puts in the gym is clearly paying off. The film received negative reviews from critics and audiences. However, Fox was praised for her performance. Harley has worked with several pregnant mothers and creates a safe workout plan for them. Prior to her pregnancy, Fox did a large number of box jumps, jumping lunges, and jump squats. According to Harley, that’s not wise to do during pregnancy or soon after giving birth. That might seem obvious but it’s still a very helpful tip. He said, “We tried to have her do minimal impact. Post-baby, there shouldn’t be a lot of jumping up and down.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=short-but-intense><strong>Short But Intense</strong></h2><p>In addition to being a famous personal trainer, Harley Pasternak is also a TV host and motivational speaker. In 2012, he co-hosted the brief health and lifestyle talk show The Revolution, which included Tim Gunn, Dr. Jennifer Ashton, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ty Pennington</a>. Harley and Fox put a lot of work into her lower body that gives her those stunning stems and derriere. She does a large number of dumbbell tap squats, jump squats, skater’s lunges, and the superman stretch for sculpting. These exercises are spread out over all the workouts and are combined with cardio and upper body. Harley noted, “A minimum of five minute cardio warm-up, a lower body sculpting exercise, an upper body toning exercise, and finally, a five-minute cool down.” Megan’s workouts are sometimes short but very intense.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-runner><strong>The Runner</strong></h2><p>In 2009, Megan reprised her role as Mikaela Banes in <i>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</i>. There was a bit of controversy as director <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Bay</a> had asked her to gain 10 pounds. He obviously has never seen her working out intensely. She was to star in the third <i>Transformers</i> film but had a very public feud with Bay. She made several outrageous comments and even compared him to Hitler. She likely kicked up her workout to deal with the stress of the situation. A really good way to deal with stress and to stay in shape is cardio. Harley notes that in order to lose weight, turn the cardio up.</p><p><strong>For cardio, Fox runs, does the treadmill, side shuffles, and backwards running.</strong></p><p>Instead of doing a 5-minute cardio cool down, Harley has Fox&nbsp;doing 30-minute cool downs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hollywood-workout><strong>Hollywood Workout</strong></h2><p>In 1999, Megan Fox began her career after winning a modeling contest at the age of 13. It launched her career and opened up doors for her. Fox has been working out intensely for most of her career. When it comes to the gym, Megan is just like anyone else. There are days that she just doesn’t want to workout and actually avoids Harley. After giving birth, she was able to get back in the gym quickly. However, when she doesn’t want to workout, she has the option of playing Harley’s video game. He said, “On the days she doesn’t want to see me, she does my video game, Harley Pasternak’s Hollywood Workout. I actually developed it for a lot of new mom clients from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jessica Simpson</a> to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hilary Duff</a>, Megan Fox, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Milla Jovovich</a>.”</p><h2 id=trampoline-training><strong>Trampoline Training</strong></h2><p>Megan Fox went from being the “it” girl of the moment to the most controversial star. She made headlines with her harsh comments about director Michael Bay and heavily criticized him. Later, an unsigned letter from the crew soon emerged, defending Bay and attacking Fox for her unpleasant demeanor on set. Fox moved on from the franchise and has expressed that she feels she contributed to her negative persona. However, years later, she reunited with Bay for <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> and reprised her role in the sequel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Harley trained Fox for the film and even accompanied her for shooting.</strong></p><p>Fox kept her training sessions going even during production. She was spotted working out on a trampoline wearing ankle weights in-between scenes. That helps explain her exceptional physique in the film.</p><h2 id=showing-off-back-tattoos><strong>Showing Off Back Tattoos</strong></h2><p>Megan’s style and fashion sense have been very influential. She is credited with making tattoo fashion popular. She has roughly nine tattoos but without a doubt, her steamiest tattoos are on her back and rib cage. On her rib cage is a poem she wrote, on her lower back is a Nietzsche quote, and on her upper back is a Shakespeare quote. She’s often showing off her back tattoos in sensual gowns. She puts in a great deal of work into her back and Harley stresses the importance of posture. Some of the back workouts include straight-leg deadlift, bent-over row, and the Superman. According to Harley,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“The problem a lot of women make is they over-train the front of their abs.”</strong></p><p>He went on to say, “There’s too much strength there and not enough in the spinal area.”</p><h2 id=keeping-up-the-intensity><strong>Keeping Up The Intensity</strong></h2><p>Harley Pasternak is also an author in addition to being a motivational speaker and personal trainer to the stars. He released two popular books, which are&nbsp;The Body Reset Diet and the 5-Factor Diet. Harley pushes his clients to work out at a high intensity, and Megan is one of his hardest-working clients. He encourages clients to keep up the high intensity, although he also notes the importance of pacing oneself. After Megan gave birth, he had her slowly get back to the high intense training sessions. He said,</p><p><strong>“Definitely within a few weeks, she was able to come back and workout. We didn’t start at full speed, we eased into it.”</strong></p><p>In fact, Megan first started doing fewer repetitions and later increased the reps as she felt more comfortable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=leaner-and-fitter><strong>Leaner And Fitter</strong></h2><p>Harley is one of the most well-known personal trainers and works with all the major stars. However, his workouts can be done by anyone and not just the rich and famous. Harley’s intense workouts are why Megan’s in such stealer shape throughout her career and after giving birth. However, even the average person can work out like Megan and do Harley’s simple but intense training routine. Many female stars like to focus on their legs and glutes, which is very important. However,</p><p><strong>Harley stresses working the upper body as well.</strong></p><p>For the upper body, Harley has Megan doing bench press, dumbbell pullover, and chest fly. According to Harley, anyone can do Megan’s workout and have her lean figure. He noted, "They might not look exactly like Megan, but a leaner, fitter version of themselves."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=increased-energy><strong>Increased Energy</strong></h2><p>Megan Fox became one of the biggest stars in the world. She has stirred up some controversy with her attitude. She was on every TV show, film, and the cover of every magazine. The media was obsessed with her and covered her every chance they got. In 2009, Askmen.com started a boycott of Fox and chose to highlight other celebs. Several other websites took the opposite approach and featured her even more.</p><p><strong>Fox decided to take a step back from the spotlight to focus on starting a family with her husband.</strong></p><p>Megan’s diet has played a crucial role in her ability to raise three young children. She switched to a paleo diet and eliminated bread. She said, “You are able to expend more energy without being exhausted.” She feels that she is now “more efficient as a mum.”</p><h2 id=ab-workout><strong>Ab Workout</strong></h2><p>Every celebrity and fan around the world wants to know Megan’s secret to her perfect abs. The secret to her success is Harley’s intense core workout. Megan raised the intensity of her workouts as her career continued to take off. Her extremely fit body is hard to miss in any of her films, especially her rock-hard abs. She started doing 3 to 4 core exercises each session. According to Harley,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“It’s not just about crunch, crunch, crunch. It’s about her body up and down and side to side and rotation.”</strong></p><p>That’s only part of her secret to her ripped abs. He added, “We train all three of her rectus abdominals, her obliques and her corset muscle to make sure that her abs are not just tight and strong, but small.”</p><h2 id=ab-workout-2><strong>Ab Workout 2</strong></h2><p>Harley brings intensity to work and many of his clients feel it; Megan Fox in particular. As noted, Megan’s abs&nbsp;are legendary in Hollywood, and Harley can give us more of an insight to her secret. Harley has Megan doing a wide range of ab exercises. They work a different ab muscle each session and alternate between obliques, lower abs, and upper abs. Despite being committed to her workout and healthy lifestyle, there are days she just doesn’t want to see Harley. She’d rather sleep in bed all day long. Unfortunately for her, it’s almost impossible to avoid Harley. Megan said, “Trainer (Harley) comes to my house 3 times a week and makes me go through the exercises. I don’t even need to leave the house….I am always like: Not Today! Not Today!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ab-secret><strong>Ab Secret</strong></h2><p>In 2007, Megan had her big breakthrough&nbsp;in the summer blockbuster Transformers. It was her breakout role that turned her into an international phenomenon over night. It featured some of her most memorable scenes, such as her (Fox) in a short skirt checking out the hood of a car. It’s easy to tell that she turned her training sessions up a notch in preparation for the role. She has kept that intensity going even after giving birth. Megan has managed to get her lean figure back soon after giving birth. She revealed that she has a specific exercise that helped her immensely with her abs after having a child.</p><p><strong>She gives all the credit to her lean figure to doing hip thrusts.</strong></p><p>According to Harley, "They helped lengthen her abs and hip flexors, while strengthening her hip extensors, back, glutes, and hamstrings."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=low-sugar-lifestyle><strong>Low-Sugar Lifestyle</strong></h2><p>Megan’s strict diet played a very important role in her getting back into shape after giving birth. It’s not enough to just work up a sweat in the gym. A healthy diet is crucial to all workouts, and Fox’s trainer knows this. She went on a low-sugar diet with three meals a day and two snacks. According to Harley, “She’ll have protein, fiber, and healthy fat in every meal. She is living a low-sugar lifestyle, definitely… She has definitely buckled down and she is amazing.”</p><p><strong>Megan prepares all of her meals and the family’s meals herself at home.</strong></p><p>She also did a great deal of cardio in addition to her diet and resistance training. For her cardio workouts, she would use a machine known as the Helix Lateral Trainer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=post-baby-workout><strong>Post-Baby Workout</strong></h2><p>In 2014, Megan Fox portrayed April O’Neil in the film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. It did very well at the box office but was heavily criticized for the pacing and story. However, Megan Fox drew a great deal of attention for her physical fitness. Prior to shooting in 2013, Fox gave birth to her first child Noah, and in 2014, she gave birth to her second child, Brodhi. In both cases, she got back into peak physical condition in time for filming and later before re-shoots. She would work with Harley three times a week doing resistance training. She would focus on dumbbell rows and back rows during their sessions. Harley said, “They’re short, these workouts. [We're] really focusing on the muscles behind her body and to draw her posture back.”</p><h2 id=hard-work-and-dedication><strong>Hard Work And Dedication</strong></h2><p>When Megan Fox first exploded onto the scene, just about every person in the world fell love with her. She is often at the very top of every Most Beautiful and Hottest lists ever created. Fox is one of Harley's best clients, so he works her hard. When it comes to the 5-minute warm up, Fox has many options. She can go the traditional route of running or try something different.
