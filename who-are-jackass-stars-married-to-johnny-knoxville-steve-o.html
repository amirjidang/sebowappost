It can’t be easy to watch your partner beat the living snot out of themselves for fun (or for a living). But, as we said, love finds a way. Jackass superstar Steve-O recently got engaged, Wee Man has been spotted around town with his latest girlfriend, Preston Lacy is single and ready to mingle, and the Jackass patriarch Johnny Knoxville has been happily married for several years now. Many of the original crew members have also been married once before their current partners. Let’s learn a little about the party-hardy stuntmen of Jackass and the women who love them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated on September 7, 2022: </strong>While Jason Acuña remains unengaged as of now, it seems as though he is serious about his relationship with partner Cassandra Brett. She very rarely posts on social media, sharing only one post so far this year, but we see plenty of her on Wee Man's page. Just earlier this month, Acuña shared several photos of a trip to Hawaii, in which Cassandra came with him.</p><h2 id=steve-o-is-engaged-to-hairstylist-lux-wright><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Steve-O Is Engaged To Hairstylist Lux Wright</span></h2><p>Steve-O was once married to a woman named Britney McGraw, but the couple divorced back in 2008, around the same time that Steve-O entered rehab for his severe drug and alcohol problems. Now 13 years sober, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve-O has found a new love</a> in hairstylist Lux Wright. The couple announced their engagement on Instagram in 2019.

Soon after the divorce, he married his next girlfriend Naomi Nelson after she gave birth to their first child in 2009.
