The show centers around the Brown family and their polygamist lifestyle. Kody Brown leads the family and is married to Meri Brown, Janelle Brown, and Robyn Brown. Formally, Kody was also married to Christine Brown. In total, Kody has 18 children across the four women.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In November 2021, Christine Brown announced that she was leaving Kody Brown. They had been spiritually married for over 20 years, but Christine claims she had been unhappy for the majority of their relationship. Currently, TLC is airing episodes of Sister Wives which were filmed while the couple were separating. Some members of the large Brown family are shocked that Christine left, while others are relieved Christine is standing up for herself. Let’s get into how Christine and Kody Brown’s children feel about their divorce.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything The ‘Sister Wives’ Kids Have Said About Polygamy And Their Dad, Kody Brown</a></span></p><h2 id=why-did-christine-leave-kody-brown><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Why Did Christine Leave Kody Brown?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Christine and Kody Brown were spiritually married in 1994. Together, they have six children ranging from 26 to 11 years old. Christine was the third woman to marry Kody, meaning their union came with the understanding that it was by a polygamist relationship. Over the years, their relationship has certainly struggled.</p><p>There are many reasons for Christine to have left Kody, but her decision ultimately boiled down to the fact that she no longer believes in polygamy. She did not feel Kody valued her as a wife or a person, especially considering they were no longer intimate. Christine left Kody in 2021, and <a href=#>Kody is still grieving the breakup</a>.</p><h2 id=ysabel-is-sad-her-parents-are-divorcing><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Ysabel Is Sad Her Parents Are Divorcing</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a recent episode of TLC’s Sister Wives, Christine and Kody Brown’s daughter Ysabel celebrated her graduation and 18th birthday with the whole family. The large gathering would likely be one of the last, since Christine moves away, so the event was bittersweet for everyone involved.</p><p>In a confessional, Ysabel revealed her thoughts on her parents splitting up after all these years. As a child, it is always heartbreaking when the child’s parents cannot make their marriage work. Ysabel expressed her sadness for her parents, as she loves them both. She also exhibited great understanding of the situation.</p><h2 id=mykelti-knew-her-parents-were-ldquo-not-in-love-rdquo><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Mykelti Knew Her Parents Were “Not In Love”</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a preview for an upcoming episode of Sister Wives, Mykelti Brown speaks about her feelings regarding her parents’ divorce. Mykelti is older than Ysabel, so she has a different perspective of her parents’ relationship. Mykelti is also married and recently welcomed her first child.</p><p>“I was honestly relieved when I heard my mom was leaving my dad,” Mykelti says during a confessional in the show Sister Wives. “They’re not happy, they’re not in love.” While harsh words, Mykelti is clearly happy that <a href=#>her mother will finally find joy in life</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Other Reason Why Sister Wives Stars Kody And Janelle Brown’s Relationship Is Gross</a></span></p><h2 id=mykelti-rsquo-s-husband-says-christine-rsquo-s-divorce-was-ldquo-inevitable-rdquo><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Mykelti’s Husband Says Christine’s Divorce Was “Inevitable”</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While not biologically related to Christine and Kody Brown, Mykelti Brown’s husband Antonio Padron also weighed in on their divorce. Padron has been around the family for a long time and is considered family. He called their divorce “inevitable.”</p><p>“<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I thought it was a little inevitable</a>,” he says about their separation. “I can’t imagine any man being perfect enough to be able to handle four wives.” Christine Brown is clearly not the only one who does not believe in polygamy in the Brown family.</p><h2 id=ysabel-is-hopeful-christine-brown-will-find-love><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Ysabel Is Hopeful Christine Brown Will Find Love</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite being sad about her parent’s divorce, 18-year-old daughter Ysabel has expressed a great understanding for the situation. She is hopeful for her mother’s future, specifically in regards to her romantic life. Since Kody does not make Christine happy, Ysabel is eager for her mother to find someone who will.</p><p>Christine is not currently looking for a new relationship as she is still processing her divorce and enjoying her freedom. However, she does know what <a href=#>her love life will be like without Kody</a>. When the time comes, Christine will look for joy, loyalty, and monogamy.</p><h2 id=paedon-rsquo-s-relationship-with-kody-brown-is-strained><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Paedon’s Relationship With Kody Brown Is Strained</span></h2><p>Christine and Kody Brown’s son Paedon has had a strained relationship with his father for a long time, but the divorce certainly did not help the situation. During the pandemic lockdown, Kody set strict rules for the entire family to follow. Paedon took issue with this, saying “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It really got on my nerves that I wasn’t allowed to see my siblings</a>.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paedon also said that his relationship with his father is “not great.” There is a strain on their relationship, but he “wishes it was better.” Paedon also commented on the fact that when he speaks to his numerous siblings, they do not talk about Christine and Kody’s divorce.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is Kody Brown’s Favorite Sister Wife?

In the current season of Sister Wives, Kody has been expressing his hatred of the plan, as he does not want his daughter to live so far away. Fans of the show will have to wait until later episodes of this season to see what kind of fall out there was regarding Truely’s move to Utah.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an effort to maintain the daddy-daughter relationship, Kody and Christine still speak to each other.
