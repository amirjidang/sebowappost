Way Home was one of the most anticipated movies of all time for one reason - it was expected that the three main Spider-Man actors were going to appear in it. Rumors constantly spread on the internet that Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield would have a significant presence in the film, and those rumors turned out to be right. Tobey, Andrew, and Tom Holland would go on to make the film an instant classic, and in turn, the film made $1.9 billion at the worldwide box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The three actors really knocked it out of the park as their versions of Peter Parker. And, without a doubt, they reminded everyone why their specific interpretation of the beloved Marvel character is amazing and iconic. The chemistry among one another was also amazing, and their bonding as a team ranked highly among the various MCU superhero teams.</p><p>Tobey, Andrew, and Tom didn't have great affection for each other for no reason. No, the three actors actually regard one another highly and have said some truly positive things about each other. Here's what they've said...</p><h2 id=how-tobey-maguire-feels-about-andrew-garfield-and-tom-holland>How Tobey Maguire Feels About Andrew Garfield And Tom Holland</h2><p>While Tom Holland is the new face of Spider-Man, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield happen to be memorable Peter Parkers for two entirely different generations. For anyone who grew up in the early 00s, Tobey was Peter Parker the same way Robert Downey Jr. was Tony Stark.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Tobey-Maguire-Spider-Man.jpeg><p>While Andrew's Spider-Man portrayal might not have been as memorable as Tobey's was, he was still a great character that most people have looked back on rather fondly.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Tobey Maguire And Carey Mulligan Could Not Keep A Serious Face Throughout Their Disastrous Interview In Australia</a></span></p><p>Tobey played Peter Parker in three separate Spider-man films, his final appearance being in 2007's Spider-Man 3. The movie had very mixed reactions, which is part of the reason the character was rebooted in 2012's The Amazing Spider-Man.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Who-Is-Andrew-Garfield-Closer-To-Tom-Holland-Or-Tobey-Maguire.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This was when Andrew began playing Peter Parker. For this film, both Tobey and Andrew did a press release with VMan where Tobey actually interview Andrew. While most of the interview was about Andrew's previous acting work, the two did touch on some Spider-Man-specific things.</p><p>They spoke about how each of their audition processes was extremely drawn-out and complicated, something that was also the case for Tom (though Tom's audition wasn't as disastrous as the time <a href=#>he tried out for Disney's Star Wars films</a>). He failed the audition of course, due to the fact that he couldn't stop laughing. Andrew even reversed the interview around on Tobey, asking him some questions about his time as Spider-Man.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/spider-man-maguire-dunst.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Overall, Tobey hasn't specifically commented on Andrew a lot. However, he did share his feelings about working with both Andrew and Tom for Spider-man: No Way Home. He told Variety that the experience working with Andrew and Tom was so great that he wants to do it again.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Tobey Maguire's Iconic Kiss With Kirsten Dunst In Spider-Man Was Actually A Nightmare For The Actor Behind The Scenes</a></span></p><p>It shouldn't be surprising Tobey is so friendly with these fellow A-list actors. He's a pretty friendly guy who lives a very interesting lifestyle. From <a href=#>random $10 million land purchases in California</a> to <a href=#>hanging out with Travis Scott</a>, he doesn't have a shortage of things to do. Tobey was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">last seen partying with Leonardo Dicaprio and Drake</a>, and was most recently featured in the hit movie Babylon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-andrew-garfield-feels-about-tobey-maguire-and-tom-holland>How Andrew Garfield Feels About Tobey Maguire And Tom Holland</h2><p>Perhaps the most outspoken actor from Spider-Man: No Way Home has been Andrew Garfield. Not only did Andrew love his time with the movie, he also really cherished his newfound relationships with Tobey and Tom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/andrew-garfield-as-spider-man-in-no-way-home-trailer.png><p>Andrew aligned with Tobey when it came to interest in doing this whole thing again. In addition, Andrew has spoken very positively about Tobey when asked about whether he sees Tobey as a mentor-like figure. Andrew indeed does, as he's confessed to it in the past. When speaking with Vanity Fair, Andrew admitted that he always wanted Tobey be "impressed" by Andrew's portrayal of Peter Parker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/andrew-garfield-emmy-2022.jpeg><p>It seems that Tobey has admired Andrew's Spider-Man interpretation. The two have been pretty close for a while, and their time together on Spider-Man: No Way Home only added to their friendship. According to Variety, Tobey was Andrew's primary guest at the initial screening for Everything Everywhere All At Once. Andrew confirmed it in an interview with Entertainment Tonight. In that same interview, Andrew touchingly confessed that he "loved" Tobey.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened Between Stephen Colbert And Andrew Garfield?</a></span></p><p>Andrew feels very similarly towards Tom, though he of course does so from the perspective of a mentor. In particular, Andrew has poked fun at Tom's uncanny ability to nearly spoil the films he stars in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During a press release interview for Spider-Man: No Way Home, Tom nearly spoiled Andrew's appearance in the film. Andrew then responded to this by laughing in an interview with BBC Radio and saying that Tom should "never change". Andrew usually pokes a little fun at Tom, truly embracing the role of big brother.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Andrew was recently cast as Frankenstein</a> in an upcoming monster adaptation helmed by horror genius Guillermo Del Toro.</p><h2 id=how-tom-holland-feels-about-tobey-maguire-and-andrew-garfield>How Tom Holland Feels About Tobey Maguire And Andrew Garfield</h2><p>While Tobey and Andrew are the older, experienced stars of the past, Tom is one of the biggest actors in the world right now. From his acting as Peter Parker to his superstar relationship with Zendaya, Tom has no lack of attention in the limelight.</p><p>Funnily enough, Tom is a big fan of his relationship with Zendaya. That might sound odd, but in this case, he is a literal fan. He was recently caught <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">liking a fan edit of Zendaya's best modeling moments</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Tom-Holland-Spider-Man.jpg><p>Both Tom and Zendaya had a lot of great things to say about Tobey and Andrew. As mentioned earlier, Tobey and Andrew see themselves as role models to Tom. Tom confessed to being nervous to meet Tobey and Andrew, but their warmness has helped Tom open up to them. This has been key to their successful chemistry in Spider-man: No Way Home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/How-Do-Andrew-Garfield-And-Tom-Hollands-Spider-Man-Stunt-Doubles-Look-Like.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All of this comes after an initial bump in Tom's relationship with Andrew. When Tom was cast as Peter, it was unclear if Andrew would return in some way as Spider-Man. Tom didn't call Andrew or speak to him in any way, and Tom said in an interview with PopBuzz that he regrets not doing so. Of course, their relationship is great now. Whatever problems they may have had are completely in the past.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKVdnbytuMCnm2aroJ6xpr7MmqVmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgYsSqwMdmq6iala56rq3GrqCrnV2Wu6W%2BxLBkoJmim7amuMNo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./1404751-impact-1000-results-september-14-2023.html>&#171;&nbsp;IMPACT 1000 Results September 14, 2023</a>
