Following his big break as the web-slinging Marvel legend, Spider-Man, in his The Amazing Spider-Man film series, the 38-year-old Brit has<a href=#> gone on to make a pretty big name</a> of himself, taking on roles in <a href=#>hugely successful films</a> and earning himself critical acclaim as an actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here’s Why Andrew Garfield Was Rejected For ‘The Chronicles Of Narnia’ Role</a></span></p><p>However, outside his career fame, the actor generally <a href=#>prefers to lead a more reserved and private life</a> away from the public eye. Despite this, throughout the years, Garfield has become somewhat of a<a href=#> heartthrob for fans worldwide</a>. The actor’s interesting dating history also shows that this title is also recognized by celebrities as much as it is by his adoring fans. So let’s take a deep dive into the talented Casanova's past and current romantic endeavors and see which celebrities were entangled with the Hollywood heart-throb.</p><h2 id=shannon-woodward><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Shannon Woodward</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Coming up first we have Garfield’s first-ever long-term relationship under the public eye with 37-year-old American actress Shannon Woodward. The Raising Hope star and Academy Award nominee began dating way back in 2008 before Garfield truly made his mark in Hollywood. Despite their busy careers as flourishing actors, the pair made their relationship work. During an interview with Parade.com, Garfield highlighted this as he mentioned that his girlfriend (Woodward) had been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">very proud of him despite his busy schedule</a>. However, the love affair promptly came to an end in 2011 a year before Garfield made his debut as Marvel’s iconic web-slinger, Peter Parker, in the first of his The Amazing Spider-Man films.</p><h2 id=emma-stone><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Emma Stone</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following his swift breakup with Woodward, Garfield soon found love in the whirlwind that was his journey as Spider-Man. In 2011 Garfield began to film The Amazing Spider-Man through which he met Emma Stone who portrayed Garfield’s love interest in the film, Gwen Stacy. Much like his web-slinging predecessor, Tobey Maguire, <a href=#>Garfield began dating his on-screen love interest</a> soon after meeting. Garfield and Stone remained together for 4 years during their time in Spider-Man and split amicably in 2015. Whilst many fans of the power couple were left heartbroken over the news, a source close to People confirmed that there had been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">no bad blood between the pair</a> and that their split had simply come down to the pair being, “busy with their careers and [that they] have not seen each other.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Andrew Garfield Reveals One Of His Most Terrifying Experiences On Set</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=susie-abromeit><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Susie Abromeit</span></h2><p>Another Marvel alum Garfield was romantically involved with was Jessica Jones star Susie Abromeit. After a 3-year break from the dating game, Garfield was spotted engaging in a<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> passionate make-out session with Abromeit</a>, on the beach in Malibu in 2018. The relationship rumors that ensued following this were fueled further when the couple then went on a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">romantic dinner together</a> according to a source at Us Weekly, in which it was stated that Abromeit, “had a certain level of glamour.” In addition to this, the article also reported on the pair’s trip to Disneyland in which they were seen giggling away together. It seems as though the relationship didn’t last very long as rumors soon circulated of Garfield’s ex <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stone attempting to break the couple up</a> according to Suggest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rita-ora><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Rita Ora</span></h2><p>Following his split from the Jessica Jones star, Garfield turned to a completely different industry for his next romance, with pop star Rita Ora. Ora and Garfield were first seen cozying up together during a leisurely stroll back in 2018. However, it seems as though their romance was also short-lived, only lasting 4 months together. According to a source close to The Sun, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Garfield was the one to call quits on the relationship</a> in favor of leading a “more private life”. This, apparently left the singer heartbroken. Despite the information gathered from the source, the previously mentioned Suggest article outlines Stone’s involvement in yet another of Garfield’s split. The article states that prior to dating the singer, Stone had warned Garfield about Ora.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Tom Holland And Andrew Garfield Embrace At GQ Awards Fueling Spider-Man Rumors Once Again</a></span></p><h2 id=a-rumored-romance-with-aisling-bea><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>A Rumored Romance With Aisling Bea</span></h2><p>Coming in next we have Irish comedian and actress Aisling Bea. Swiftly following his split from Ora, Garfield was seen <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">attending a night in the theater </a>with the This Way Up actress. However, the relationship between the two is mainly speculation as neither the comedian nor the Spider-Man icon either confirmed or denied the pairing.</p><h2 id=christine-gabel><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Christine Gabel</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moving onto one of Garfield’s most recent romantic endeavors we have model and medical student, Christine Gabel. News of the model and actor’s relationship initially surfaced back in the summer of 2019 when the pair were spotted taking a cute romantic walk together through downtown L.A. According to a source close to Radar Online, back then it seemed as though the pair would turn out to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> develop a serious relationship</a>.</p><p>The source stated, “It looks like it could turn serious pretty fast, Andrew and Christine seem really into each other. I've seen them together, and you can just tell they had a strong connection right off the bat."</p><h2 id=alyssa-miller><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Alyssa Miller</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite Gabel and Garfield’s “strong connection” and 2-year relationship, it seems as though the model is no longer in the picture. Garfield’s most recent (and current as of today) relationship is with <a href=#>32-year-old American model, Alyssa Miller</a>. Garfield and Miller were first spotted taking a stroll together back in November 2021 and have since been papped together multiple times. In February 2022, the pair <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stepped out together on the red-carpet for the first time</a> as a couple during the 2022 SAG awards in which Garfield was nominated for an Outstanding Performance By A Male Actor In A Leading Role award for his <a href=#>portrayal of Jonathan Larson in Tick, Tick…Boom!</a></p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>‘The Social Network’: Why Was It Hard For Jesse Eisenberg And Andrew Garfield To Stay In Character?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp5yimsRus8CrnaKdnJnAbrLApqauq12ctrO4xaugnqaUqHqkscuemauhpK56qbvOpKypq18%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./are-greys-anatomy-stars-katherine-heigl-and-tr-knight-still-friends-greys-anatomy-controversy.html>&#171;&nbsp;Are Greys Anatomy Stars Katherine Heigl And T.R.
