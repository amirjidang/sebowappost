The latter had to pause production late 2021 after a failed daredevil stunt. The show has been nominated for many awards, including nine PrimeTime Emmys, five People’s Choice Awards, and six Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards.</p><p>Though they haven’t wrapped up auditions just yet for season 17, the show has already created waves in the media with the newest season. Howie Mandel even said the season finale will be one of the “toughest years'' yet. Season 17 might be far from over, but it has already created one major star.</p><h2 id=america-s-got-talent-hasn-t-had-great-luck-recently><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>America's Got Talent Hasn't Had Great Luck Recently</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>AGT has had its fair share of PR crises, from the Gabrielle Union firing scandal from a few years ago to rumors that the show is rigged, and the audience is trained to respond positively and negatively to certain contestants in advance. <a href=#>One finalist was even arrested recently</a>, so it makes sense that AGT is now hand-picking some of its contestants.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="What Happened To These America's Got Talent Golden Buzzer Winners">What Happened To These America's Got Talent Golden Buzzer Winners</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-kieran-rhodes-and-how-did-agt-find-him><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Who Is Kieran Rhodes And How Did AGT Find Him?</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kieran Rhodes is a native of New York</a>, having grown up in Burnt Hills, New York. His musical journey started with learning to play the piano and eventually turned into songwriting. The likes of Billy Joel, Randy Newman, and James Taylor have influenced Kieran’s music.

Before this chance meeting he hadn’t even considered this, he told the Times Union, "Frankly, 'America's Got Talent' wasn't even a thought in my mind at all," adding "She saw me play and came to me and said 'I need to have you on the show.'"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="How AGT's Jackie Evancho Earned Her Incredible Net Worth">How AGT's Jackie Evancho Earned Her Incredible Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=kieran-rhodes-performed-an-original-and-touching-song-on-the-agt-stage><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kieran Rhodes Performed An Original (And Touching) Song On The AGT Stage</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kieran Rhodes started off his audition with a rendition of Billy Joel’s “She’s Got A Way”. However, he was cut off by the judges who asked him to perform his original “Disengaged”, which blew the judges away. His performance went viral, which in itself is a big win even if he doesn’t make it all the way. It's not just the contestants' careers that have grown thanks to America's Got Talent; <a href=#>Howie Mandel's daughter has used her connections to her benefit</a>.</p><h2 id=what-kieran-rhodes-did-before-music><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>What Kieran Rhodes Did Before Music</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kieran Rhodes spent practically most of his life preparing for a baseball career. In the middle of high school, the former Varsity baseball player discovered his talent for music, realizing that it was actually his passion. In the years that followed, he began to play the piano, sing, and later write songs. “My friends poked fun of me because I wasn’t a 100 percent jock anymore. It was a complete change, but my coaches were very, very supportive of my decision to do music. I’m very grateful,” he told Times Union.</p><h2 id=kieran-rhodes-went-from-self-taught-to-berklee><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Kieran Rhodes Went From Self-Taught To Berklee</span></h2><p>Kieran Rhodes went from teaching himself to play the piano after having a “weird urge” to play his mom’s piano. Through YouTube videos, he began to learn how to play the guitar by watching artists such as Billy Joel, Elton John, and James Taylor. He accompanied the jazz band in his junior year at Burnt Hills-Ballston Lake High School; he's now a student at Berklee College of Music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=where-kieran-rhodes-music-comes-from><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Where Kieran Rhodes' Music Comes From</span></h2><p>Rhodes' mother, Mia Scirocco, who was in the audience, is also a performer. He started playing his mother’s piano during his freshman year at his Burnt Hills High School. That is where his love for music began and has continued to grow ever since.</p><h2 id=is-kieran-rhodes-song-disengage-his-only-original-song><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Is Kieran Rhodes' Song 'Disengage' His Only Original Song?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The singer/songwriter had been busy prior to AGT. Kieran Rhodes has already released eight singles and an EP, "On the Corner of Somewhere Street." A single from his EP called "What Got Into You," garnered over 30,000 streams and earned him an honorable mention in the 2021 American Songwriter Contest. His audition has already racked up close to 3 million views on YouTube.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="Was Robert De Niro Booed Off Stage On America's Got Talent?">Was Robert De Niro Booed Off Stage On America's Got Talent?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBut8ieqZqmXae1sLDErGSan6Ris6q6w6xkmqWRr7avs4ysoKeflad6tLvNoK6roaSav3A%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./paul-nassif.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is Paul Nassif dating?
