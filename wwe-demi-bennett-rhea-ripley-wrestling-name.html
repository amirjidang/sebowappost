It’s been a decade since she first stepped inside a wrestling ring for the first time. Hailing from Adelaide, Australia, Ripley first got her start in wrestling with the help of a local promotion called Riot City Wrestling. Over the next few years, Ripley would capture championship belts in many different promotions, and it wasn’t long before she got a gig to work for WWE.</p><p>Ripley signed with the Stamford-based promotion in 2017 and did the <a href=#>Mae Young Classic</a>. Nothing interesting happened at that time for Ripley, but things took a turn when WWE announced the inception of NXT UK. Rhea ended up winning the inaugural NXT UK Women’s Championship and also created the record of being the first-ever Australian-based female wrestler to win a championship belt in the company. She later joined the NXT brand and had a successful run there, although most fans didn’t like how she lost the NXT Women’s Title to Charlotte Flair of all people at WrestleMania 36.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rhea-ripley-won-her-first-championship-on-the-main-roster-at-wrestlemania-37>Rhea Ripley Won Her First Championship On The Main Roster At WrestleMania 37</h2><h3 id=defeated-asuka-for-the-raw-women-39-s-championship>Defeated Asuka For The Raw Women's Championship</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/asuka-v-rhea-ripley-wrestlemania-37-cropped.jpg><p>Fast forward a year later, and Ripley finally captured her first main roster title when <a href=#>she defeated Asuka at WrestleMania 37</a>. Unfortunately, this was one of those times where Ripley should’ve lost. The match felt odd at times, and it seemed more fans wanted Asuka to have her WrestleMania moment than see Ripley win. And they weren’t wrong; it had only been a while since Rhea was on the main roster and she wasn’t even originally supposed to face The Empress of Tomorrow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A few months later, she lost the title to Charlotte in one of the most fiery matches in recent history, and not a lot of fans were surprised to see her lose. WWE had botched her main roster run, and it was clear that her title reign had been nothing but a flop. At that time, the name Rhea Ripley held some stock, but it was mostly due to her run in NXT. The next few storylines were mostly filler; they didn’t really do much to elevate Ripley until she turned heel against Liv Morgan. Rumors said she was going to join Edge’s new faction, and that became a reality when she helped The Rated R Superstar at WrestleMania Backlash last year. A lot of things have happened since – her winning the 2023 Women’s Royal Rumble Match, winning the SmackDown Women’s Championship from Charlotte Flair at WrestleMania 39, and <a href=#>taking more of a leadership role in the Judgment Day</a> are just to name a few. Today, it truly feels that Rhea Ripley has become a prominent name in wrestling; everyone keeps talking about her online, and she’s an integral part of WWE's weekly programming.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-rhea-ripley-came-up-with-her-ring-name>How Rhea Ripley Came Up With Her Ring Name</h2><h3 id=googled-quot-badass-female-names-quot>Googled "Badass Female Names"</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rhea-ripley-women-s-world-champion-crown-jewel-2023-cropped.jpg><p>This brings us back to the question, how did she even come up with her ring name? Well, Ripley herself answered the question some time back on Allan & Carly when the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interviewer asked if the Ripley part in her name came from the fact that she was so ripped</a>. Rhea laughed, and said that wasn’t the case. She explained her first name is the name of a Greek goddess called Rhea, who’s also called the mother of gods. The Ripley part came from the Alien movie’s character Ellen Ripley. Rhea was actually looking for some “badass female names,” and just combined these two names, and it turned out to be perfect. She is indeed one of the most badass female wrestlers in WWE right now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Ripley is currently enjoying a lot of success right now as the Women’s World Champion, <a href=#>there are several issues with her title reign</a> that may or may not be a huge concern for WWE right now. Nevertheless, she’s the highlight of Judgment Day. Her relationship with Dominik Mysterio is another interesting aspect of her career, but in recent weeks, she’s indicated that she wants more than just Dominik. Everything is looking to work out perfectly for “Mami,” and it doesn’t look like her momentum will take a hit anytime soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenrLJusMSmoGaalaO7psDTZqmhnZFiv6q8y56wZq%2BimsC1uMinnmamkaKycA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./how-much-money-does-steve-shubin-jr-make-latest-steve-shubin-jr-net-worth-income-salary.html>&#171;&nbsp;How Much Money Does Steve Shubin Jr. Make?
