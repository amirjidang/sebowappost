While Hollywood can appear to be a massive entity, it is quite a small world, as both Ellen and Jen have become the best of friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their friendship first began in the mid-90s and has blossomed into one of our favourite celebrity friendships to date. Not only has Aniston appeared on 'The Ellen Show' more times than we can count, but she and Ellen have formed a bond unlike any other we have ever seen.</p><p>The two have worked together, lived by one another, and have supported each other through the ups and downs of both their lives and careers. If there is one friendship that we can get behind, it is definitely Ellen and Jennifer's. If you aren't sure just how close these two, here is a timeline of 15 photos showing Ellen and Aniston's close friendship.</p><h2 id=film-premiere---1998><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Film Premiere - 1998</span></h2><p>Jennifer Aniston and Ellen DeGeneres have definitely been friends for much longer than we could have ever imagined. The two have been kicking it back since the late 90s, and were even photographed together at Jennifer Aniston's 1998 movie premiere for 'The Object Of My Affection'.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ellen-s-first-ever-guest---2003><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Ellen's First-Ever Guest - 2003</span></h2><p>While we know the two have built quite the loving bond, many fans of both Jennifer Aniston and Ellen DeGeneres might not know that Jennifer was actually Ellen's first-ever guest on her talk show! The 'Ellen Show' premiered way back in 2003, and Aniston made history as being the first-ever guest to appear on the show.</p><h2 id=makeup-meltdown---2012><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Makeup Meltdown - 2012</span></h2><p>Over the course of the next decade, Ellen and Jennifer would become very close! The two have spoken openly about living very close to one another, and have supported each other through it all. Flashforward to 2012, and it appears they've gotten so close that Jennifer Aniston felt comfortable enough to let her friend Ellen play around with some makeup during a sketch for 'The Ellen Show'.</p><h2 id=people-s-choice-awards---2013><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>People's Choice Awards - 2013</span></h2><p>There was no denying that these two were the best of friends! Not only is Jennifer Aniston close with Ellen, but in turn, she has also developed a very close relationship with Ellen's wife and fellow actress, Portia De Rossi. The three of them were spotted posing backstage at the 2013 People's Choice Awards, in which they have all successfully won numerous awards!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Surprising Facts About Ellen & Portia De Rossi's Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=friends-reunion---2013><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>'FRIENDS' Reunion - 2013</span></h2><p>As the two began to get closer and closer, it was really up to Ellen to get what everyone had been waiting for, a 'Friends' reunion. In 2013, Ellen was one of the first people to get up to three cast members from the iconic show, to act in a hilarious sketch! Jennifer starred alongside former castmates Courtney Cox and Matthew Perry in what will probably be the closest thing we will get to a 'Friends' reunion ever.</p><h2 id=fun-for-the-whole-family---2014><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Fun For The Whole Family - 2014</span></h2><p>Jennifer Aniston has appeared on 'The Ellen Show' more times than we can remember, so much that she even guest-hosted twice! With that being said, Ellen's show is a place for the whole family, and fans were delighted back in 2014 when Jennifer Aniston appeared with her famous dad, John Aniston, on the talk show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wedding-bells---2014><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Wedding Bells - 2014</span></h2><p>In 2014, it was revealed that Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux were engaged to be married! This was major news at the times, and one person that revelled in excitement was none other than Ellen. Jennifer paid Ellen a visit on her show, where the two gabbed about wedding planning and details surrounding the magical day.</p><h2 id=sumo-ing-it-up---2016><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Sumo-ing It Up - 2016</span></h2><p>Jennifer and Ellen share quite the special bond, so much that the two can be extremely silly with one another, so much that they even went as far as dressing up in inflatable sumo wrestler costumes for a segment on 'The Ellen Show' back in 2016. It was at this moment that is was very clear that Aniston was a ride or die kind of friend.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here Are 15 Things Jennifer Aniston Does To Look So Young & Fit</a></span></p><h2 id=endless-support-system---2017><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Endless Support System - 2017</span></h2><p>Fans and viewers worldwide could see just how special of a friendship these two shared. It was revealed that when Jennifer Aniston's private plane had to make an emergency landing, Ellen was the first person to send her a text to make sure everything was alright. The moment was quite scary, Aniston recalls, and she was delighted to see that her good friend Ellen was the first to reach out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-tres-amigas---2018><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Tres Amigas - 2018</span></h2><p>While we are certainly jealous of Ellen and Jennifer's friendship, we have gotten even more jealous knowing that the two are also very close with former first lady, Michelle Obama!

They say opposites attract, but it is very clear that Ellen and Jennifer are very much like-minded people who have done great things with their platforms.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston Breaks Down In Tears On 'The Ellen Show'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cooking-up-a-storm---2018><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Cooking Up A Storm - 2018</span></h2><p>One of our favourite Ellen and Jennifer memories was back in 2018 when the two decided to spice things up on the 'Ellen Show' stage alongside Ayesha Curry. With Curry's cookbook having just been released, it was only fitting to have Ellen and Jennifer cook with her and judging by the episode, it looks like they had the best time.</p><h2 id=the-bestfriend-brawl---2019><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The Bestfriend Brawl - 2019</span></h2><p>Ellen can be very territorial, and rightfully so, however, when Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon began working on their 'Morning Show' project together, Ellen got a little bit jealous. During Reese's visit to the 'Ellen Show' last year, she and Ellen had a back and forth over who was better friends with Aniston. After Witherspoon left the stage, Ellen phoned Jennifer to ensure that she was her best friend, in which Aniston confirmed with a whopping yes. Sorry, Reese!</p><h2 id=golden-globes---2020><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Golden Globes - 2020</span></h2><p>We first saw Ellen and Jennifer back in 1998 at Aniston's movie premiere, and here we are 22 years later, and the two are closer than ever. They were spotted posing together at the 2020 Golden Globes alongside Charlize Theron, and it is definitely heartwarming to see that their friendship has come such a long way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=always-there-to-help---2020><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Always There To Help - 2020</span></h2><p>To wrap things up, we wanted to show just how supportive these two are of one another. The 2020 Golden Globes saw many memorable moments, however, our favourite is none other than Ellen being the good friend that she is!
