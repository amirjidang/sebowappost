At one point, she said she wanted to marry Chleb. Now that they're officially done, is there a new potential husband in the Bravo star's life? Here's what we know about Kathryn's dating life and if she has a new boyfriend.</p><h2 id=kathryn-revealed-she-39-s-still-single-at-bravocon-2022>Kathryn Revealed She's Still Single At Bravocon 2022</h2><p><a href=#>Bravo celebrities spilled all kinds of tea at Bravocon 2022</a>, Kathryn included. During the Southern Charm panel, questions about the stars dating life and current status were fair game. Kathryn made it clear she's still having fun and exploring her new singleness, but if the right guy comes around, she won't be afraid to take another chance on love.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chleb and Kathryn moved in together before their breakup. She needed time to make the space hers again. But she took the time to grieve the relationship and is ready to get back out there. When speaking with USWeekly at the event, the bravo star said, "I've been dating; I've gone on dates with some really great guys. They aren't from Charleston - so that's been great!"</p><p>Kathryn confirmed there's no one, in particular, she's pursuing a relationship with, emphasizing she's very single at the moment. She also made a pretty stark revelation about her feelings about the relationship with Chleb, admitting she regrets it entirely. Her costar Olivia was stunned at Kathryn's revelation. "Maybe not the whole relationship, but parts of it, yes I regret. Things were not great," said the star. ​​​​​​​</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kathryn added that things happened after the show aired that escalated her feelings of regret. On an episode of Watch What Happens Live, she shared that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she didn't like Chleb opening up to her longtime nemesis Naomie Olindo about their relationship problems</a>, let alone on-screen. She said she felt weird watching it and that the conversation was inappropriate.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Cast Of Bravo's Southern Charm Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></span></p><p>Kathryn is also accusing her ex of owing her thousands of dollars. When asked if they are in contact, she said Chleb doesn't respond to her attempts at communication. As for her and Naomie's relationship, it seems that she and her costar were able to squash their beef night one of Bravocon. The women were pictured partying and smiling together throughout the weekend. ​​​​​​​</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jason-cameron-from-winter-house-slid-into-kathryn-39-s-dms>Jason Cameron From Winter House Slid Into Kathryn's DMs</h2><p>There are a ton of crazy crossovers between bravo celebrities at Bravocon, and some come with a little more spark to them than others. That was the case for Jason Cameron and Kathryn Dennis. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The pair apparently hit it off instantly</a> after meeting at the 3-day event.</p><p>They first met at Vanderpump Rule star Tom Sandoval's concert on Saturday, where they chatted for a bit. Jason told friends he thinks Kathryn has a cute accent and great energy. Before leaving for the night, Jason told Kathryn the two should keep in touch and that he would slide into her DM's.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Is Jason Cameron?

She said she thought Jason was nice and confirmed he followed up on his promise of DM'ing her. Insiders say the two are just getting to know each other, but they're keen on staying in touch. Who knows, maybe Kathryn will be the next Southern Charm cast member to make an appearance on Winter House.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-chleb-ravenell-39-s-dating-life-like>What Is Chleb Ravenell's Dating Life Like?</h2><p>While we know a lot about what Kathryn's dating life has been like since the split, we don't know much about Chleb. Apart from promoting the new season of Southern Charm that he's featured on and going out with friends, he hasn't shared much about his life post-Kathryn. We know he's still in Charleston. Chleb did share a snippet of an interview he did with TBT Magazine via his Instagram recently. In it, he reflected on how hard it was to break up with someone you love on national television. ​​​​​​​</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chleb lost a lot of fans support during that conversation</a> with Naomie. They felt he was trashing Kathryn in the conversation. Viewers also accused Chleb of lying, as he quickly changed the story with Kathryn when she asked what he and Naomie were talking about. But it doesn't seem like Southern Charm fans are on Chleb's side in this split.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiimqyYp8avecOepaeho2KvsMXFq6CeppRiu7DDjJqdrZ2iYrCpuMSbZKuZppq7prjLaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./donald-sterling-sit-down-anderson-cooper-220754.html>&#171;&nbsp;Donald Sterling To Sit Down With Anderson Cooper</a>
