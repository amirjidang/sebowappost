actor. His commercial successes in these areas bring his earnings to an estimated $12 million. Here’s more on the ladies man’s journey to a successful show business&nbsp;career.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=trey-songzs-life-before-the-fame></span>Trey Songz’s Life Before The Fame<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Trey Songz was born&nbsp;Tremaine Aldon Neverson on&nbsp;November 28, 1984, in&nbsp;Petersburg, Virginia. Born to a teenage mom who later married a US soldier, Trey Songz from the age of 7 grew up as a military brat moving from state to state&nbsp;anytime his stepfather was transferred to a different military base. When he was 14, his family returned to&nbsp;Petersburg, Virginia and he immediately enrolled in&nbsp;Petersburg High School.</p><p>As a&nbsp;youth, Songz would often croon his favorite songs while in the bathroom but the extremely shy teenager never had any&nbsp;plans of launching a career in music. However, that soon changed when he found himself drowning in compliments about&nbsp;such&nbsp;a lovely voice he had. Following much coaxing&nbsp;from friends, Trey&nbsp;began singing more often and even took part in the&nbsp;Appomattox Regional Governor’s School Talent Show in Petersburg in 1998.</p><p>His family though not having enough money to help him launch a music career, supported his music interest by turning up to his first stage performance. His mom came to the talent show with a group of 20 just to cheer up her little boy. Fortunately, Trey’s performance was a success as the fans couldn’t help but fall in love with his voice.</p><p>The successful talent show would turn out to mark the beginning of Trey’s journey to a successful musical career as he attracted the attention of New Jersey-based record producer&nbsp;Troy Taylor.&nbsp;Trey waited until graduation before turning his entire focus to music. However, while in high school, he formed a music group&nbsp;All Night Productions which often performed in local parties, he would also spend his summers with Taylor in New Jersey making music. Trey graduated from Petersburg High in 2003 and completely moved in with Taylor who helped hone his musical skills.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=start-of-music-career></span>Start of Music Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In his graduation year, Trey Songz, thanks to Troy Taylor, inked a deal with Atlantic Records receiving an upfront pay of $100,000. To set the pace for a successful album, Trey began by recording mixtapes under the moniker “Prince of Virginia”. His technique paid off as one of his tracks titled&nbsp;“Open the Closet”, answers track to R. Kelly‘s&nbsp;“Trapped in the Closet”&nbsp;earned him a moderate fan base. His debut studio album&nbsp;“I Gotta Make It” was released on July 26, 2005. Though it didn’t bring him mainstream exposure, it was moderately successful peaking at&nbsp;#20 on the Billboard 200 and selling over 40,000 copies in week 1 and later almost 400,000 in the US. The album was preceded by the debut single “Gotta Make It” which featured rapper Twista and the second single “Gotta Go” which enjoyed more success than the first.</p><p>Trey’s second album “Trey Day” released in 2006 was more successful than the first, peaking at #11 on The Billboard 200 and selling over 400,000 in the US. The album spawned his first commercial hit “Can’t Help But Wait” which became his first Top 20 song on the Hot 100. Trey Day brought Trey Songz his first Grammy and BET Award nominations.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=worldwide-recognition-and-new-image></span>Worldwide Recognition And New Image<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Still not satisfied with the level of success he was getting, (his albums were yet to receive certification from the RIAA), Trey opted for a makeover, image-wise and music-wise. Previously known for soulful and soft R&B music, Trey incorporated extreme sensual and hip-hop elements in his third studio album “Ready” (2009). Image-wise, Trey appeared more mature, neglecting his braids, jean and sneaker look for a sultry&nbsp;bad boy look. And it sure paid off. “Ready” sold&nbsp;131,000 copies in its first week and went on to sell over&nbsp;1 million copies in the US becoming his first platinum-certified album. It peaked at #3 on the Billboard 200 and produced top hits like&nbsp; “I Need a Girl”,&nbsp; “Say Aah”, and&nbsp;“Successful” and&nbsp;“I Invented Sex” both featuring Drake.</p><p>The once shy Trey has since boldly incorporated hyper-sexual lyrics and images in his music. Trey’s fifth studio album Chapter V preceded by the hit single “Heart Attack” became his first #1 Billboard 200 album and the first to chart in the United Kingdom. Trigga’s singles and albums&nbsp;have sold a combined 14 million worldwide.</p><p>Trey Songz has received 3 Grammy nominations and won 2 Soul Train Music Awards and 1 BET Award for&nbsp;Best Male R&B Artist.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=other-ventures></span>Other Ventures<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In addition to making music, Trey Songz is also an occasional actor. He’s taken up acting roles in movies like “Texas Chainsaw 3D” (2013), “Baggage Claim” (2013) and “Brother’s Blood” (2016).</p><p>As a way of giving back to society, Trey founded “Songz For Peace Foundation”. The foundation aims at spreading a positive message to young people in a bid to control youthful violence. The rapper has in the past spoken passionately about starting his own family and raising kids.</p><p>Trey Songz, like his fellow celebrities, has endorsed several luxury brands like Cherry Noire and Moet. However, the chief of them is his&nbsp;partnership with SX Liquor which he also shills. Some of the brand’s drinks have been featured in his music videos. Songz in June 2016,&nbsp;threw a lavish $80,000 party in his hometown of Virginia&nbsp;which secondarily promoted the liquor brand. Celebrities that have made multi-millions from alcohol partnerships include Diddy, Jay-Z, Justin Timberlake, Ludacris, and Ne-Yo. Trey, in his interview with Forbes, revealed that he looks to make the same success from alcohol like his colleagues.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-he-have-a-girlfriend-and-what-about-the-gay-rumors></span>Does He Have A Girlfriend And What About The Gay Rumors?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Trey Songz has publicly stated that he is not gay. This came after a man that resembles the singer, was captured smooching another fellow. The photo hit the internet and caused a major storm as Trey was making loads of money off his sultry&nbsp;bad boy look.</p><p>With that, Trey has gone ahead to have dated some of the sexiest women Hollywood has had to offer. They include&nbsp;singer Tanaya Henry, dancer Helen Gedlu, actress Lauren London and many others.</p><p>The one woman we can authoritatively say has been close to Trey’s heart is his mother,&nbsp;April Tucker. The both of them are very close, and she describes him as “a regular guy with a God-given voice and talent for writing.”</p><p>Trey Songz has two brothers, Forrest Tucker and Alex Neverson. Forrest is an aspiring model while Alex is a DJ and producer. His stage name is DJ A-Wall and he has produced a number of songs for his brother.</p><table id=tablepress-381 class="tablepress tablepress-id-381"><tr class="row-1 odd"><th class=column-1>Profile Summary</th><th class=column-2>&nbsp;</th></tr><tbody class=row-hover><tr class="row-2 even"><td class=column-1>First Name:</td><td class=column-2>Tremaine</td></tr><tr class="row-3 odd"><td class=column-1>Last Name:</td><td class=column-2>Neverson</td></tr><tr class="row-4 even"><td class=column-1>Also Known As:</td><td class=column-2>Trey Songz, Tremaine, Trigga, Trigga Trey, Mr. Steal Yo Girl, Prince of Virginia.</td></tr><tr class="row-5 odd"><td class=column-1>Sex/Gender:</td><td class=column-2>Male</td></tr><tr class="row-6 even"><td class=column-1>Profession:</td><td class=column-2>Singer, Songwriter, and Actor</td></tr><tr class="row-7 odd"><td class=column-1>Famous For:</td><td class=column-2>His famous hits: “Heart Attack”, “Gotta Make It”</td></tr><tr class="row-8 even"><td class=column-1>Colleges/Universities Attended:</td><td class=column-2>N/A</td></tr><tr class="row-9 odd"><td class=column-1>Educational Qualifications:</td><td class=column-2>N/A</td></tr><tr class="row-10 even"><td class=column-1>Religion:</td><td class=column-2>Christianity</td></tr><tr class="row-11 odd"><td colspan=2 class=column-1><strong>Birthday & Zodiac</strong></td></tr><tr class="row-12 even"><td class=column-1>Age/Date of Birth:</td><td class=column-2>November 28, 1984</td></tr><tr class="row-13 odd"><td class=column-1>Zodiac Sign:</td><td class=column-2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr class="row-14 even"><td class=column-1>Birth Place:</td><td class=column-2>Petersburg, Virginia, U.S.</td></tr><tr class="row-15 odd"><td class=column-1>Nationality:</td><td class=column-2>American</td></tr><tr class="row-16 even"><td class=column-1>Ethnicity/Race:</td><td class=column-2>Cameroonian roots</td></tr><tr class="row-17 odd"><td class=column-1>Country of Residence:</td><td class=column-2>United States of America (USA)</td></tr><tr class="row-18 even"><td colspan=2 class=column-1><strong>Physical Attributes</strong></td></tr><tr class="row-19 odd"><td class=column-1>Height:</td><td class=column-2>6 feet, 2 inches (1.87 m)</td></tr><tr class="row-20 even"><td class=column-1>Weight:</td><td class=column-2>87 kg (192)</td></tr><tr class="row-21 odd"><td class=column-1>Eye Colour:</td><td class=column-2>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr class="row-22 even"><td class=column-1>Hair Color:</td><td class=column-2>Black</td></tr><tr class="row-23 odd"><td class=column-1>Other Body Measurements:</td><td class=column-2>Chest: 45 inches<br>Waist: 33inches<br>Arm/Biceps: 16inches</td></tr><tr class="row-24 even"><td class=column-1><strong>Relationships</strong></td></tr><tr class="row-25 odd"><td class=column-1>Marital Status:</td><td class=column-2>Dating</td></tr><tr class="row-26 even"><td class=column-1>Spouse/Partner:</td><td class=column-2>Lori Harvey</td></tr><tr class="row-27 odd"><td colspan=2 class=column-1><strong>Family and Relatives</strong></td></tr><tr class="row-28 even"><td class=column-1>Father:</td><td class=column-2>Claude Neverson Jr</td></tr><tr class="row-29 odd"><td class=column-1>Mother:</td><td class=column-2>April (Gholson) Tucker</td></tr><tr class="row-30 even"><td class=column-1>Children:</td><td class=column-2>Noah (Born April 20, 2019)</td></tr><tr class="row-31 odd"><td class=column-1>Siblings:</td><td class=column-2>Alex Neverson (Brother),<br>Forrest Neverson (Brother),<br>Nikki Neverson (Sister)</td></tr><tr class="row-32 even"><td class=column-1>Other Relatives:</td><td class=column-2>N/A</td></tr><tr class="row-33 odd"><td class=column-1><strong>Net Worth</strong></td></tr><tr class="row-34 even"><td class=column-1>Estimated Net Worth:</td><td class=column-2>$12 million</td></tr><tr class="row-35 odd"><td class=column-1>Salary:</td><td class=column-2>$1.7 million annually</td></tr><tr class="row-36 even"><td class=column-1>Source of Wealth:</td><td class=column-2>Record sales, tours, and acting jobs</td></tr></tbody></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaGpgZ35utM6wZK2qla56tLvNoLFmmpWYrq6xjJpkpq2jnrButcKopWaZnpl6tb7UrZ9mmZKkwrV506GcZp%2BRrnqzwcyoqaxn</p></div><div id=links><a href=./highest-grossing-benedict-cumberbatch-movies.html>&#171;&nbsp;In The Multiverse Of Money: The Highest-Grossing Benedict Cumberbatch Movies</a>
