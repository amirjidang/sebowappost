David and Victoria Beckham. He’s a household name thanks to his star status as a celebrity kid who has basically been given everything in life to him. When you’ve got a father who is an internationally-known soccer star who many call one of the best in the world and a mother who is a former pop star and a fashion designer, you’re destined for great things in your life, right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Well, unfortunately for someone like Brooklyn Beckham, he doesn’t have his father’s footsie skills on the pitch, his mothers appeal as a pop star, or her talent as a fashion designer. Despite all of this, Brooklyn is still trying his best to stay relevant in the entertainment world. The only problem is that no one is taking him very seriously. But that hasn’t stopped him from trying to make a name for himself – even if that name ends with Beckham.</p><p>With that being said, we have 15 reasons why Brooklyn Beckham might never make it in the industry, despite all of the help he gets from his parents.</p><h2 id=he-s-not-taking-college-seriously><strong>He’s Not Taking College Seriously</strong></h2><p>A lot of people would agree that Brooklyn Beckham wants a few things in life, and they of course include fame and recognition. Unfortunately, Brooklyn hasn’t shown the world that he has what it takes to become a huge star in his own right. Now, that’s not to say that he doesn’t have the talent or the skill. Instead, he might not have the discipline or the determination to even make it through one semester of college.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“He blew into Parsons with a massive ego. The diva act didn’t fly with other students and they ostracized him,” sniped a source to Star Magazine, adding that Brooklyn was acting as if he was too cool for school. “Brooklyn spent a lot of time bragging about his famous friends all the A-list parties he gets invited to. No one was impressed!”</strong></p><p>If that weren’t enough, Brooklyn is treating his college education like he really doesn’t need it. If that were the case, his parents David and Victoria Beckham wouldn’t have pushed him so hard to pursue a college education in the first place, right?</p><p>“He’s telling people he’s leaving school for these incredible, far-better professional opportunities,” [laughs] the insider. “But really, he’s just mad because no one worshiped him like he expected they would.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=all-he-has-is-his-last-name><strong>All He Has Is His Last Name</strong></h2><p>Truth be told, the only thing that Brooklyn Beckham has going for himself these days is his last name. If it weren’t for his name recognition, no one would be paying much attention to him. At least, that’s what his critics believe.</p><p>And while a lot can be said about David and Victoria Beckham, one thing is for certain: the love their children and have worked hard to protect their family and give their kids the life they deserve. In fact, Brooklyn himself has said time and time again that he loves his parents and that they mean the world to him.</p><p><strong>If it weren’t for his mother and father, Brooklyn knows that his life would be very different than the one he has today. In other words, he is well aware of how lucky he is.</strong></p><p>He told Wonderland Magazine that he didn’t know his parents were actually famous until his teen years. He said, “I didn’t actually know that they were big until I was about 13.” Almost five years later he explains, “I went to a football game and people were shouting my dad’s name and I was like, ‘What?! Oh my God.’ I don’t look at them like that.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-doesn-t-have-his-father-s-talent><strong>He Doesn’t Have His Father’s Talent</strong></h2><p>At one point during his teen years, Brooklyn tried to be a huge soccer star like his father David Beckham, but it just didn’t work out for him. As much as he tried to impress everyone, he didn’t live up to the Beckham name in the international football world. With that being said, he just doesn’t have his father’s gift or talent as an athlete. For some fathers, they see it as a huge disappointment. But fortunately for Brooklyn, that wasn’t the case at all.</p><p><strong>David Beckham has often proved himself to be a very loving, caring and understanding father.</strong></p><p>David once said (via The Daily Mail) during his career: “When I was a kid, I thought my dad was a little bit harsh with me at times. Sometimes I needed an arm around me instead of my dad telling me what I did wrong, but it obviously worked. I'm a very stubborn person. I think it has helped me over my career. I'm sure it has hindered me at times as well, but not too many times. I know that if I set my mind to do something, even if people are saying I can't do it, I will achieve it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-doesn-t-have-his-mother-s-determination><strong>He Doesn't Have His Mother’s Determination</strong></h2><p>For years, Victoria Beckham has always had to do one thing, and that’s fight off her critics. People have slammed her in every direction possible, hinting that she isn’t a very good singer or a very good fashion designer. But if there is one thing that Victoria has, it’s determination. She’s always been determined to make the most out of her career and of course, do what’s best for her family. She’s never put any pressure on Brooklyn or any of her other kids to be famous or to work in the entertainment field.</p><p><strong>The same of course can be said about his dad, David Beckham, “In fact, he’s never implied that he wanted any of his children to follow his footsteps by becoming soccer stars. Instead, all he wants them to do is follow their dreams and passions, whatever they may be.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet, Brooklyn has always taken a liking for his mother’s field and decided that he wanted to work in by becoming a photographer. “I do backstage photography at my mum’s shows, and I mean, I love doing it — but my mum’s like, ‘Go take pictures of the models!’ and I’m a bit shy,” he told <a href=#>GQ</a> in the magazine’s September issue. “So I kind of have to get the first two out of the way, and then I’m used to it.”</p><h2 id=he-s-grown-up-with-a-silver-spoon-in-his-mouth><strong>He’s Grown Up With A Silver Spoon In His Mouth</strong></h2><p>Brooklyn Beckham has had the kind of&nbsp;luck that a lot of people can only dream of having. To put it simply, he’s grown up with a silver spoon in his mouth. Whatever he wanted, he&nbsp;got almost instantly, thanks to his parents David and Victoria Beckham. And the same can be said about his (supposed) career as a photographer. It was Brooklyn’s parents who made it happen for him. Now as far as he has any actual talent as a photographer, remains to be seen. But for now, he’s been working very hard to promote himself as the “next best thing” in the entertainment industry. The only thing is, a lot of people aren’t buying it. In fact, they aren’t even buying his photography book for that matter, either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“My favorite outfit is like a Peaky Blinders kind of look,” he told <a href=#>GQ</a>&nbsp;back in 2017. “I have a really old-man style. I’m also really into skateboarding outfits, like the baggy Vans jeans? But I don’t like dressing saggy, like American my-age kids do. I don’t really ask to take pictures of people. I kind of just get in their face. So some people hate it. Some people find it funny.”</p><h2 id=he-has-no-concept-of-reality><strong>He Has No Concept Of Reality</strong></h2><p>Brooklyn Beckham has never really lived a “regular life,” so to speak. He never had to live life on a budget, get a job like most normal teenagers his age or better yet, hear the word “no.” Sure, David and Victoria Beckham have done a great job of raising their children to be very well-mannered, polite and articulate. We have to give credit where credit is due. But at the same time, they have no concept of what reality is. Brooklyn has no idea that a lot of kids his age will never get to see, do or achieve the things he’s already had in his life. He also thinks that with his parents help, he can be just about anything he wants to be, at any given day. The real world simply doesn’t work that way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>"I never thought I would actually be an author," Beckham told W Magazine. "But it's been really fun and a cool experience seeing how much I’ve changed — and my mum and dad are really proud of me, which is dope."</strong></p><p>"I prefer black and white and portrait photography. I like old, you know interesting faces, so I think black and white brings out the contrast.”</p><h2 id=he-might-tarnish-the-beckham-brand><strong>He Might&nbsp;Tarnish The Beckham Brand</strong></h2><p>For the longest time Brooklyn Beckham really didn’t know what he wanted to do in his life. Even though he’s gotten everything served to him on a silver platter, he knew in the back of his head that he still wanted to achieve what his parents have achieved in their lives. Unfortunately for Brooklyn, he never stuck with just one thing. At one point, he did want to become just like his father David Beckham by being an international super soccer sensation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>His ex girlfriend Chloe Moretz once told Teen Vogue back in 2014, “What I find really interesting about Brooklyn — and what I really love about that kid — is that he is passionate about what he wants, which is to be a professional soccer player.”</strong></p><p>Clearly, that never happened. As much as it would have been great for Brooklyn to follow in his father’s footsteps, he simply didn’t have what it takes to become a great soccer star. Of course, not every kid does. But for David and Victoria Beckham, they do have to be careful, especially with the steps that Brooklyn Beckham takes. They don’t want him to ruin the Beckham brand by appearing incompetent or worse, average.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-s-never-done-anything-on-his-own><strong>He’s Never Done Anything On His Own</strong></h2><p>The Beckhams have moved a lot of in the last ten years. In fact, Brooklyn has never really had a stable home in his life. His parents uprooted their family from London to Madrid and then to Los Angeles. Even though they are back at home in London now, some reports have indicated that the Beckhams might soon move to Miami, where David wants to start his own soccer team. And if that happens, there’s a good chance that Brooklyn might follow suit. After all, he’s never really done anything on his own, or be on his own for that matter. Each and every time he’s in New York City, he makes his way back to London at any given time.</p><p><strong>He relies so much on his parents David and Victoria that he can’t leave their side. At least, that’s how the outside world sees it. He’s the ultimate baby boy in their family.</strong></p><p>He told W Magazine, “I mean, when I go out, I kind of put a hat on and glasses, so I’m kind of just like a photographer going around taking pictures, and people hopefully don’t recognize me. But sometimes they do, and then I’ll do a photo for them, too.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=reports-of-nepotism><strong>Reports Of Nepotism</strong></h2><p>No matter what Brooklyn Beckham will attempt to do in his life, a lot of people will say that he’s only in the position that he is because of his parents. At this point, Brooklyn would be better off changing his entire name, especially if he still wants to prove that he can make it on his own and without his parents help. But that doesn’t seem to be the case. Back in 2016, Brooklyn had the opportunity to photograph Burberry’s new ad campaign. And as you can imagine, everyone had one word in mind when they found out about it: nepotism. Because what teenager out there gets the opportunity to work on an ad campaign for a major fashion house? The answer: no one.</p><p>The Daily Mail put it this way: “Most teenagers could at most dream of an internship at a fashion house where the biggest task they would be entrusted with would be making the tea. So when Brooklyn Beckham, 16, stepped behind the lens this weekend to shoot Burberry’s latest ad campaign, it understandably led commentators to question how the teenager managed to land such a prestigious role. Fashion fans and professional photographers alike took to social media to express their unhappiness, claiming ‘nepotism’ was at play.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-wants-to-be-taken-seriously><strong>He Wants To Be Taken Seriously</strong></h2><p>Now, we’ve already mentioned that Brooklyn Beckham relies heavily on his parents and the Beckham brand for his photography career to happen. And while no one knows what is in store for his future, one thing is for certain: Brooklyn wants to be taken seriously. He doesn’t want to end up being the laughing stock of the entertainment industry. And he certainly doesn’t want to be seen as a failure. That’s why he is determined to prove to critics that yes, he has what it takes to create the kind of photography that people will talk about for years to come. He has an artist’s soul, even if other people don’t believe it or see it for that matter. Of course, Brooklyn has plenty of time ahead of him to prove everyone wrong.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brooklyn told W Magazine, “When people knew I was shooting Burberry, everyone was kind of — some were annoyed, and I kind of got quite a bit of hate for that. But I think once the photos came out, people could really see that photography was my thing that I wanted to do. So I feel like people are starting to take me more seriously as a photographer now.”</p><h2 id=he-s-never-really-had-to-work-hard-for-himself><strong>He’s Never Really Had To Work Hard For Himself</strong></h2><p>Victoria’s rise to fame came thanks to the hugely successful Spice Girls and of course, David Beckham became a household name thanks to his great soccer skills on the pitch. But when it comes to Brooklyn, everything is done for him, including all of the behind-the-scenes work for his photographer. In fact, it’s been hinted that David and Victoria Beckham go as far as making sure all of the work is done, just to avoid any embarrassing disasters. Some critics have noted that Brooklyn Beckham has no idea what he’s doing, especially when it comes to photography. If it weren’t for the team of experts that his parents have hired for him, he would be nothing more than just another kid on Instagram taking pics. Well, everyone knows he does that anyway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jon Gorrigan, a photographer who has worked with Esquire, Grazia and the Observer, had this to say: “He’s obviously not going to be doing the lighting, he’ll have no clue of the programmes, the cameras or Photoshop. It’s going to be so well managed – he’ll have the best hair and makeup, the best models, the very best equipment, so that the chance of any risk is greatly reduced.”</p><h2 id=in-fact-he-has-never-had-work-hard-at-all><strong>In Fact, He Has Never Had Work Hard At All</strong></h2><p>But then again, has Brooklyn really worked a day in his life. Does he know what an 8-hour day looks like? Or better yet, does he have any concept of the hard work it takes to create something truly wonderful and long lasting? Victoria has worked endless hours making her fashion shows look great. The same can be said about David on the soccer pitch. Brooklyn, meanwhile, is yet to learn what work really is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He told W Magazine last year, “I mean, people are always going to know me as Victoria and David Beckham’s son, and people thought that [I've gotten this] because of my parents — and part of it maybe, yeah, of course, it does help, but I’m just trying to make my own way. That’s why I’m moving to New York now — I’m trying to make a name for myself, and just really start my photography career and live as a student, which will be cool and I’m excited about. I want to really study and learn about fashion, and kind of discipline for a few years, really start to study, and then probably start my photography career. I feel like that’d be really good for me — to disappear for a few years.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-photography-work-has-gotten-harsh-reviews><strong>His Photography Work Has Gotten Harsh Reviews</strong></h2><p>With all of that being said, Brooklyn is yet to get any positive reviews for his photography work. In fact, his photography book, What I See, has gotten some of the harshest criticism that the publishing industry has ever seen. People have said everything under the sun that needs to be said about what they call subpar photography. Some have even said that he should stick to what he knows best, and that’s taking Instagram photos. Otherwise, he just needs to put the camera down and give it a rest already. There are plenty of photographers in the industry who have had amazing results but unfortunately, not the same kind of promotion that David received for his book. But then again, anyone can just pick up a camera and call themselves a photographer, right? You have to have a certain eye to make the photographs work.</p><p>“David and Victoria Beckham represent sheer willpower and graft," fashion photographer Chris Floyd told The Guardian last year. "Especially her, she’s climbed that mountain all by herself. They represent hard work and then their 16-year-old year son comes along and it’s sheer nepotism. He hasn’t done it from hard work, which is counter-intuitive to what his parents represent."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-doesn-t-have-that-star-appeal><strong>He Doesn’t Have That Star Appeal</strong></h2><p>A lot of critics would agree that Brooklyn Beckham simply doesn’t have that star appeal that his parents once had, or still have, for that matter. Sure, Victoria may not be the best fashion designer out there, but people pay attention to her just because they want to see her. They also want to see what she’s capable of producing. In addition, both Victoria and David are huge A-list celebrities who have managed to stay at the top for almost two decades. That can’t be said about everyone. That’s because they’ve got the kind of star appeal that other couples simply don't have. For Victoria, she knows that part of her success is mostly due to her celebrity package.</p><p>His mother Victoria once said, “There's nothing wrong with constructive criticism, and I learn from that and better myself. I'm not expecting anyone to be sycophantic in any way; I never expected that. I want my kids to have a good work ethic. I believe you can achieve anything if you work hard enough to get it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, whether or not Victoria has ever given her son Brooklyn any constructive criticism about his work remains to be seen. Watch this space.</p><h2 id=critics-label-him-as-a-try-hard><strong>Critics Label Him As A Try-Hard</strong></h2><p>Simply put, a lot of Brooklyn Beckham’s critics label him as a try-hard, and trust us, that’s not a good thing at all. He’s either trying too hard to be stylish, hip, or painfully cool. He’s trying too hard to stay relevant. He’s trying too hard to be popular on Instagram. And he’s trying too hard to be a famed celebrity photographer. In other words, he’s trying too hard to be anyone but himself. Brooklyn Beckham would be better off being Brooklyn Beckham.</p><p><strong>Plus, who can ever forget this photo of Brooklyn with his mother Victoria last year. Try hard, much? She captioned it with, “We are all so proud of you Brooklyn. Amazing A level results and off to college. We love you so much and will miss you. #yesiamcrying #emotional.”</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While there is&nbsp;no doubt that Victoria loves her son very much (and is obviously proud of him too), a lot of people have pointed out that this photo is a little too close for comfort. And it’s obviously a mother and son duo who are trying too hard to get our attention. Well, that part worked, obviously. We get it. They want everyone on this planet to like them. The only problem, though, is that they need to try less.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpZWK%2Fpq3SqKWsZaedxm6u0aimpKSpo3qjscKkn5qlXaK2qLTTZqWerpWneq6typ5koqxdnrtuwMeeZKKmlKrAtb7YaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./3-year-old-boy-left-behind-in-a-utah-corn-maze-w508398.html>&#171;&nbsp;3-Year-Old Boy Left Behind in a Utah Corn Maze</a>
