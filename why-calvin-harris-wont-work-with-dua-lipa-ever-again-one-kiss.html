However, they have both denied it. Harris, 39, has dated other big pop stars, like singer <strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a></strong> and Rita Ora, so it's no surprise fans shipped him and Dua Lipa. The Scottish DJ isn’t dating anyone currently since he’s married to Capital 1 FM DJ Vick Hope. However, the real reason Calvin Harris won't be making music with the New Rules singer anytime soon has nothing to do with their rumored romance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-dua-lipa-and-calvin-harris-ever-date>Did Dua Lipa And Calvin Harris Ever Date?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/283351362_3044591252518353_9034057328481490368_n.jpg><p>As famous artists in London, Dua Lipa and Calvin Harris were bound to bump into each other sooner or later. The two met briefly<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> at a party</a> they both attended sometime in 2015. After that, they both followed each other on Twitter and before long, they were working together on hit singles.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Dua Lipa Nearly Got Arrested For Assaulting A Police Officer At 15</a></span></p><p>In an episode of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Graham Norton Show</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> where Dua Lipa and Calvin Harris were guests,</a> they shared how they ended up working on the DJ’s hit single, One Kiss. The track was the fastest-selling single of 2018 and topped the charts in several countries. In 2022, the single was certified quadruple platinum by RIAA after selling 4,000,000 units in the United States.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Harris revealed during the interview that all he did was slide into the singer’s DMs on Twitter, which gave the audience the idea that they were doing more than just talking about new music. Lipa added, “Yeah, slid into the DMs … it’s a great form of contact, lots of stuff happens on Twitter. People make friends on Twitter.” Due to the star's awkward responses and rich chemistry during the interview, many fans<a href=#> suspected they were dating.</a></p><h2 id=what-happened-to-calvin-harris-rsquo-relationship-with-taylor-swift>What Happened To Calvin Harris’ Relationship With Taylor Swift?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Calvin Harris’ relationships</a> have made headlines for decades owing to the mega-popular stars he dates. His relationship with Taylor Swift was all over the tabloids after it ended in a messy rant on Twitter. Harris got emotional after fans speculated Swift co-wrote his 2016 hit, <a href=#>‘This Is What You Came For’</a> featuring <strong><a href=#>Rihanna</a></strong>. He addressed Swift in a series of tweets, saying if she was happy in her new relationship, she should focus on it instead of trying to tear him down. “Please focus on the positive aspects of YOUR life because you’ve earned a great one.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A year later, the DJ apologized for his public outburst, admitting it wasn’t the best move for him as a public figure. He told British GQ, “I was protecting what I see as my one talent in the world being belittled. It felt like things were piling on top of me, and that was when I snapped. It’s very difficult when something I consider so personal plays out very publicly.”</p><p>Calvin added that he struggled with the celebrity lifestyle, and when his relationship with Swift ended "all hell broke loose.” When asked why his relationship with Swift ended, he revealed their situation wasn’t right, so it ended. The Bad Blood singer dated Loki actor Tom Hiddleston after the DJ before dating <a href=#>Joe Alwyn for six years</a>. The duo managed to keep their relationship private before splitting in 2023.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-calvin-harris-won-rsquo-t-work-with-dua-lipa-on-another-song>Why Calvin Harris Won’t Work With Dua Lipa On Another Song</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar49397877.jpg><p>After working on "One Kiss," Dua Lipa and Calvin Harri teamed up again to release the catchy hit, "Potion," featuring Young Thug. The 2022 track from Harris’ sixth album, Funk Wave Bounces Vol 2, did well but not as well as their first collaboration. But the single wasn’t supposed to happen because of one of Harris’ rules.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Dua Lipa Seems To Have A Things For Very, Very Rich Men, Here's Who She's Dated</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During an interview on BBC Radio 2’s The Zoe Ball Breakfast Show, the Summer hitmaker said that he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">doesn’t do more than one song </a>with an artist. The only other artist whom he’s collaborated with on more than one single was the band Florence + The Machine. “I did that remix for Spectrum, and then I did Sweet Nothing. I think that’s the only time I’ve ever done a song with the same person twice, and it worked.”</p><p>The Scot explained why fans shouldn’t expect another collaboration between him and Dua Lipa, “I feel like sometimes, as a rule, it’s just the one. I actually wouldn’t have done a second. Probably a third would be pushing it.” Despite his feelings about working with Lipa again, he is proud of her success.</p><h2 id=who-is-calvin-harris-39-wife-vick-hope>Who Is Calvin Harris' Wife, Vick Hope?</h2><p>After his breakup with Taylor Swift, Calvin Harris dated his ex, Aarila Wolf, from 2018 to 2022. From then, he began a relationship with 33-year-old Vick Hope. She was spotted with a £1 million engagement ring in May 2022, sparking rumours about her and Harris’ relationship. In September 2023, the couple married in an intimate ceremony in northeast England, surrounded by close family and friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hope spoke out about her relationship with Harris and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their decision to keep it away</a> from the public eye. “We don't really put anything on social media because the time we have together is 'real life' and it's our own. For the first time in a long time, I'm finishing work and going home to a life that is just mine. I'm learning to find balance and peace.”</p><p>The BBC Radio 1 presenter and Harris have known each other for years and would have probably gotten together long ago if she hadn’t rejected him. She shared the tale with You Magazine of how Harris tried to make a move in her in 2007, but she wasn’t interested. “It’s something that we laughed about on our first date. We still laugh about it now.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmK6twsinZKGZoqe2tHnWqKWtZaekv6x51qKroWWUqq5uuMipmGadppq%2Fbq3GmqCnZZ%2Bjsm63yKyqaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./richest-soccer-player-athletes.html>&#171;&nbsp;Will Johnson (MLS) Net Worth</a>
