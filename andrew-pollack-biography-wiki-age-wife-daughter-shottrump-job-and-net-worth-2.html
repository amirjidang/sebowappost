His daughter Meadow Pollack who died when she was 18-year-old was killed in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting on February 14, 2018.</strong><span id=more-156927></span></p><p>Andrew is publicly acknowledged with helping to pass the “Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act” (Florida Senate Bill: 7026). So far he has met with President Donald Trump and his cabinet, Florida governor Rick Scott, and many lawmakers.&nbsp; He is actively fighting to increase more federal funding to increase school security in every school across the nation. Andrew believes that bulletproof glass, metal detectors, enhanced door lock systems, ID checkpoints, and “school marshals” can help prevent school shootings.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=andrew-pollack-job></span>Andrew Pollack Job<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Andrew whose daughter Meadow was killed in the deadly school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School quietly resigned from a state commission formed to investigate the shooting in order to pursue his own probe.</p><p>Andrew among the more outspoken Parkland parents, submitted a resignation letter following the commission’s first meeting in April, announcing that he was leaving. He wrote in the letter dated May 4 and read Thursday morning into the record by commission chairman Sheriff Bob Gualtieri that he wants to focus on the upcoming Broward School Board elections and on an independent investigation in which he’s involved.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=andrew-pollock-age></span>Andrew Pollock Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Andrew was born on February 18, 1966, in Oceanside, New York, <strong>United State</strong>.&nbsp; He is 53 years old as of 2019.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=andrew-pollack-family></span>Andrew Pollack Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=andrew-pollack-wife></span>Andrew Pollack Wife<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He lives in Chabad of Coral Springs with his wife, Dr. Julie Phillips Pollack, an emergency room physician, and their 2-year-old Belgian Malinois, Sonny. The wheels on the 4-by-4 truck that anchors their Eagle Cap camper home are a symbol of Pollack’s every intention to escape Broward County, its “unethical Democrat” politicians and the “sick, demented” people who support them.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=andrew-pollack-daughter></span>Andrew Pollack Daughter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Andrew’s daughter Meadow Jade Pollack who was born on October 5, 1999, and died on February 14, 2018, was murdered in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.&nbsp; She was shot four times and had attempted to avoid the shooter while struggling to get into a classroom. Teachers and students were not able to open the classroom door. Andrew told CBN that as the shooter returned, her daughter covered another student in an attempt to protect them. She was then shot five more times, killing her and the other student she shielded, Cara Loughran, a freshman.</p><p>Her death prompted her father to found Meadow’s Movement, a movement fighting for increased school security to prevent future school massacres. Meadow planned to attend Lynn University in the fall and spoke about becoming a lawyer.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=andrew-pollack-facts-and-body-measurements></span>Andrew Pollack Facts and Body Measurements<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Andrew Pollack</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> February 18, 1966</li><li><strong>Place of Birth:</strong> Oceanside, New York, U.S.</li><li><strong>Birthday:</strong> 18th February.</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Fathers Name:</strong> Not available</li><li><strong>Mothers Name:</strong> Not available</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> Not available</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> married</li><li><strong>Children/ Kids: </strong>three children</li><li><strong>Height/ How tall?: </strong>Not available</li><li><strong>Weight: </strong>Not available</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=andrew-pollack-net-worth></span>Andrew Pollack Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Andrew has never revealed his estimated net worth.
