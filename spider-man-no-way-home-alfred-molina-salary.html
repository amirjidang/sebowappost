After his character was killed in Spider-Man 2, fans were curious to see if Marvel would use the multiverse to bring back the fan-favorite villain. They did, but just how much did it cost to get Mr. Molina back in the mechanical octopus suit?</p><h2 id=how-much-did-alfred-molina-make-for-his-appearance-in-spider-man-no-way-home>How Much Did Alfred Molina Make For His Appearance In Spider-Man No Way Home?</h2><p>It had been 17 years since Alfred played Doc Ock when producers called the actor with the new Spider-Man script. "For me, it's just about the money," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">joked the actor during a panel featuring all three villains from the film</a>. During those 17 years, the actor continued along his phenomenal career track.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From starring in the 2004 Broadway revival of Fiddler On The Roof to beginning a successful voice acting career and landing roles in Rango and Frozen II, the actor was far from struggling. With a resume as impressive as his, he's well-positioned<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> to ask producers for more money than your average actor</a>.</p><p>We don't know how much Alfred made for Spider-Man No Way Home,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> though his net worth did make about a $2 million jump between 2019 and 2021</a>. According to Looper.com, Andrew Garfield was paid $1 million for his return to the movie. Considering that information, we can estimate that Alfred made at least $1 million for his reprisal. <a href=#>Considering the movie made almost $2 billion</a>, they could afford to pay Alfred well for his reprisal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-alfred-molina-want-to-come-back-for-spider-man-no-way-home>Did Alfred Molina Want To Come Back For Spider-Man No Way Home?</h2><p>Despite the long pause between movies, Alfred was excited to revisit the character of Dr. Otto Octavius, aka Doc Ock. During that same villains' panel with his co-stars, Alfred said that while the material he received from producers was excellent, he was confused about how it would work all these years later.</p><p>"I, to be honest, when the idea was first suggested, my first thought was, 'Hang on, I'm 17 years older. I've got chins; I've got wrinkles. What are they going to do?'" said Alfred during the panel. "Then, of course, I suddenly realized, wait a minute, they've got the technology, this isn't going to be a problem," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He then worried about his physical capabilities. Sure, CGI could fix the wrinkles, but could it prevent him from not being able to maneuver around on set like he'd aged? "I don't have the same physicality that I had 17 years ago. That's a fact," said Alfred during an interview with Vanity Fair. "I then remembered that it's the tentacles that do all the work!"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Movies That Turned Out Great With CGI (And 5 Totally Awful)</a></span></p><p>Alfred then explained to the interviewer that his acting regimen for the role of Doc Ock is actually rather...easy. "My basic physical move as Doc Ock, as the actor, is just this," the actor said to the interviewer as he stared at her with a menacing face. "I just do that a lot, and the arms are doing all the killing and smashing and breaking." <a href=#>Fans were ecstatic to see Alfred reprise the role</a>, which must make all his stress about perfecting the performance worth it in the end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-alfred-molina-spoil-spider-man-no-way-home-for-fans>How Did Alfred Molina Spoil Spider-Man No Way Home For Fans?</h2><p>If there's one thing Alfred Molina isn't good at, it's keeping a secret. The production teams at Sony and Marvel asked the actor to keep the news of his return under wraps, as the guest cameos in the movie were to be a secret until the film debuted in December 2021. But the actor ultimately came clean about his involvement before the movie was showing, <a href=#>confirming his role to Vanity Fair in April 2021</a>.âââââââ</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"When we were shooting it, we were all under orders not to talk about it, because it was supposed to be some great big secret," said the actor. "But, you know, it's all over the internet. I actually described myself as the worst kept secret in Hollywood," he continued.âââââââ</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's What Willem Dafoe And Alfred Molina Got Up To In The Two Decades Between 'Spider-Man' Movies</a></span></p><p>Alfred got a lot of heat from producers over his conversation with Vanity Fair, and the actor isn't going to make the same mistake twice. During an interview with RadioTimes.com, the actor had a planned response when the actor was asked about popping up in another Spider-Man movie. "I can neither confirm nor deny. That's the official line. I got into a bit of trouble over the last iteration because I happened to let the cat out of the bag quite innocently," said Alfred.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While fans were most excited than angry with the news, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">apparently, Kevin Fiege didn't take Alfred's admission lightly.</a> According to Alfred, "Kevin Feige was on the red carpet somewhere, and somebody asked him about some Marvel movie and apparently, he got a bit snippy and turned around and said, 'Ask Alfred Molina'." The actor and Kevin have since swept things under the rug, but Alfred was terrified of possible retributions of his actions for a moment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqqaGUmr9uucCnZKenXayuunnHqKSeZZGhs7Oxw2akqKSZo65uv8ClmKuxXw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./is-jim-norton-transgender-sexuality-partner-and-dating-history.html>&#171;&nbsp;Is Jim Norton Transgender?
