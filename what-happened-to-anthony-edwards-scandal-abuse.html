First off, there were two sequels to Revenge of the Nerds and there recently was a planned remake that was <a href=#>scrapped while filming</a>. More recently, <a href=#>Miles Teller got a huge payday</a> for starring as the son of Edwards' character in Top Gun: Maverick.</p><p>On top of Edwards' film credits, the talented actor also starred in one of the most acclaimed TV shows of all time, the medical drama ER. After Edwards decided to leave that show, he mostly disappeared from Hollywood for several years.</p><p>Once Edwards started focusing on acting once more after his initial sabbatical, he took a step back from the spotlight once again. In recent years, Edwards' reasons for giving up acting both times have been revealed, and they are inspiring and heartbreaking.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-anthony-edwards-quit-er>Why Did Anthony Edwards Quit ER?</h2><p>Over the decades, Hollywood has seen a long list of actors come and go.

Still, when Edwards' character, Dr. Marke Greene, left the show, viewers truly were heartbroken.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/anthony-edwards-and-george-clooney.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Revealed to have been suffering from an aggressive form of brain cancer, Edwards' character took his final breath in a beautifully written episode of television.</p><p>Given that ER's producers did such a marvelous job writing out Edwards' character, it was hard for fans to be mad that the actor left the show. That said, they were still left with a simple question, why did Edwards decide to leave the show he starred in for so long?</p><p>Before Edwards' character made his final ER appearance, he spoke to the Associated Press about why he chose to leave the show. While Edwards commented about how long he'd already been starring in ER up until that point, it seemed clear that wasn't the real reason he was leaving the show. Instead, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Edwards opted to quit ER for the best reason possible</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/anthony-edwards-as-dr-mark-greene.jpg><p>"I think [the 2001-02 season] will be it.

During their more than twenty years together, Edwards and Lobell welcomed four children into the world, one son and three daughters.</p><p>While Edwards' kids almost certainly were very proud of their dad during his tenure starring in ER, there is nothing quite like getting to spend time with someone you love.</p><p>After Edwards and Lobell's divorce, he went on to elope with Mare Winningham, the actor who was closely associated with the Brat Pack.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-anthony-edwards-give-up-acting-the-second-time>Why Did Anthony Edwards Give Up Acting The Second Time?</h2><p>When most fans think about Anthony Edwards' career, they remember the movies and shows he starred in as an adult. What a lot of people don't realize, however, is that Edwards actually began acting when he was a child.</p><p>In 1973, Edwards appeared in a little-known film titled Big Zapper. The same year that Big Zapper was released, Edwards turned eleven years old.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Struggles Of Fame: The Pros And 4 Cons Of Being A Child Star In Hollywood</a></span></p><p>Since Edwards didn't become famous until later in life, it would be a stretch to call him a former child star. Still, the fact remains that Edwards became an actor before he was in his teens.</p><p>In 2017, Edwards penned a piece for medium.com where he gave readers a window into what he went through when he was still a child actor.</p><p>In that article, Edwards started by referring to film producer Gary Goddard as his "mentor, teacher and friend". Throughout the rest of the article, Edwards wrote about how <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he and his best friend were abused by Goddard</a> for many years after they met when Anthony was 12.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Furthermore, Edwards wrote about how Goddard used the young actor's vulnerabilities to manipulate him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/anthony-edwards-1.jpg><p>In response to what Edwards wrote, a rep for Goddard put out a statement <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">denying all of Anthony's claims</a>. “As to the allegations that Mr. Edwards made in his post today, I can unequivocally deny them on Gary’s behalf.”</p><p>When considering the denial issued on Goddard's behalf, it is worth noting that two other people publicly accused him of similar abuses.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Celebrities Had Extremely Tragic Childhoods</a></span></p><p>After Medium published Edwards' piece in 2017, he stopped acting until 2022 aside from playing a recurring role in ten episodes of Designated Survivor that aired in 2019.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2022, Esquire published an article about how Edwards was returning to acting. In that piece, it was revealed that after Edwards revealed his story to the public, he mostly gave up acting, so he could <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spend the next several years trying to heal from the trauma</a> of his past.</p><p>"And he has been gone for a while, indeed; he stepped back in the early aughts to raise his kids, and then again a few years ago to heal from a trauma he’d endured in his youth, a situation he revealed publicly in 2017."</p><p>Of course, it is tragic to know that Edwards had to step away from the career he spent years pursuing and was so passionate about because of what he went through as a child. However, something else the Esquire article revealed is inspiring.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/anthony-edwards-now.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Processing his own trauma has also made him an activist; through his non-profit organization 1 in 6, he can use his familiarity and charm to connect with and help heal fellow survivors of s**ual abuse."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bq3NrZ%2BopqlisqXDwKubrGWjmK6vsMClZJqapaiycA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./the-mlbs-most-expensive-hd-scoreboards.html>&#171;&nbsp;The MLB's 10 Most Expensive HD Scoreboards</a>
