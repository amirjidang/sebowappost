Kylie cut ties with her best friend Jordyn Woods back in February after she admitted to getting cozy with Tristan Thompson, Khloe Kardashian’s baby daddy. Kylie had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to distance herself from Jordyn</a> to show support and solidarity to her sister. However, Jordyn’s spot is now unavailable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anastasia Karanikolaou, who also goes by the names Stassie, Stas, and Stassiebaby, is currently occupying Jordyn’s spot. Stassie was born in June 1997 in California. Many people assume that Stassie only got into Kylie’s life recently after Jordyn left but as we are about to see, this is not the case. She has been in Kylie’s life much longer than people assume and is well acquainted with the Kardashian-Jenner family.</p><p>Stassie is not just Kylie’s ‘wing lady’; she has a job and has a lot going for her that has not been brought by her association with Kylie. Although she appears to be beside Kylie throughout, she has a lot going on for her. Here is what we know about Stassie and what she really does.</p><h2 id=stassie-is-of-greek-descent><span class=item-num>15 </span><span><strong>Stassie Is Of Greek Descent</strong></span></h2><p>Although <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stassie was born in California</a>, she is of Greek descent hence her long and hard to pronounce surname. Her father is a World Financial Group Greek-born Broker by the name Periklis Nikolaos Karanikolaou. Stassie and her father have a close relationship as he features on her social media pages a lot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicolette-karanikolaou-is-her-step-mom><span class=item-num>14 </span><span><strong>Nicolette </strong><strong>Karanikolaou Is Her Step Mom</strong></span></h2><p>Stassie calls Nicolette Karanikolaou her mother. However, Nicolette is not Stassie’s biological mother. There is not a lot of information about Stassie’s birth mother but Nicolette has taken up the role very well. Stassie and her stepmother are also close. Nicolette occasionally posts shout outs to her daughter.</p><h2 id=she-has-a-sister><span class=item-num>13 </span><span><strong>She Has A Sister</strong></span></h2><p>Alexia Karanikolaou also features a lot on Stassie’s social media pages. She is also Nicolette’s stepdaughter given a recent post she put on her Instagram page wishing her husband, Periklis a happy 48th birthday. In the post, she referred to Stassie and Alexia as her husband’s daughter.</p><h2 id=stassie-is-a-model><span class=item-num>12 </span><span><strong>Stassie Is A </strong><strong>Model</strong></span></h2><p>Stassie is a professional model. She has appeared in a few magazines including the Teen Vogue. She has modeled professionally for Good American and Pretty Little Thing, which are owned by Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian respectively.

Stassie was however famous even before people started linking her to the youngest Kardashian-Jenner. Stassie had a massive social media following on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Vine. She has almost eight million followers on Instagram and slightly over 500k YouTube subscribers.</p><h2 id=the-model-has-a-swim-suit-line><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><strong>The Model Has A Swim Suit Line</strong></span></h2><p>Like her bestie, Stassie is also business-minded. Other than making money from her posts, Stassie has a swimsuit line by the name TJ Swim. She has admitted that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie was instrumental in the design process</a>. Stassie had Kylie and some of her friends try out the swimwear before she launched it. Their feedback has incorporated into the designs that the model has put out now.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Jenner Just Bought A Lot Of Land...

She frequently spent time with Kylie and Jordyn. However, in order to remain in Kylie’s good graces after the Jordyn scandal broke out, she has kept her distance from Jordyn. Kylie’s former best friend does not also feature anymore on her social media pages.</p><h2 id=stassie-has-lived-with-kylie><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><strong>Stassie Has Lived With Kylie</strong></span></h2><p>Kylie, Jordyn, and Stassie were close. At one point, they were all living together. Kylie accommodated the girls in her mansion for some time. Jordyn moved out after her fall out with the Kardashian-Jenners. Stassie on the other hand recently purchased a home.

In the process, she made some high profile friendships. Among the friends she shares with the Jenners include Hailey Baldwin and Jaden Smith. Her friendship with the Kardashians continues to expose her to more celebrities.</p><h2 id=stassie-has-had-plastic-surgery><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>Stassie Has Had Plastic Surgery</strong></span></h2><p>Unlike Kylie who took a while before confirming that she was using lip filler, Stassie is not afraid of admitting to the cosmetic surgeries she has had done. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stassie has had two breast augmentation surgeries</a>&nbsp;Stassie’s asymmetrical bust, nearly a full cup difference, was the reason she had the first surgery. Like her bestie, she is also a fan of lip fillers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-has-a-tattoo-of-stormi><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>She Has A Tattoo Of Stormi</strong></span></h2><p>Stassie has a few tattoos on her body.
