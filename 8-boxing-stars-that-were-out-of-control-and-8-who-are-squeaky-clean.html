This was best seen in the lead up to his match with Sugar Ray Leonard, where he talked trash relentlessly to Leonard and even Leonard's wife. After the victory, Duran went on a party spree that made him out of shape for the rematch and he ultimately quit that fight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2>Squeaky Clean - Sugar Ray Leonard</h2>[caption id="attachment_717358" align="alignnone" width="1260"] <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Sugar_Ray_Leonard.jpg alt width=1260 height=1687 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> Via: Wikipedia[/caption]On the other side of the spectrum, Sugar Ray Leonard was known as America's sweetheart when he was in the prime of his boxing career. Leonard was on cereal boxes, in adds for coca-cola and was an Olympic hero. The only real controversy was that he had a child with his girlfriend out of wedlock, which was a big deal at the time.<h2>Out Of Control - Oscar De La Hoya</h2>[caption id="attachment_717354" align="alignnone" width="1200"] <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/oscar-de-la-hoya-9542428-1-402.jpg alt width=1200 height=1200 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> Via: Biography.com[/caption]Oscar was the hero for many Mexican-Americans who needed someone to look up to. It's too bad after his career he has dived into shady dealings like his shot at MMA, exploiting a retired legend in Chuck Liddel and all of the cocaine rumours. Let's not forget that infamous photo as well.<h2>Squeaky Clean - Sugar Ray Robinson</h2>[caption id="attachment_717347" align="alignnone" width="1200"] <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DKG2POKADBNC5SULUYLX7YJGYU.jpg alt width=1200 height=1500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> Via: NY Daily News[/caption]Bringing up someone who might just be older than old school, Sugar Ray Robinson was one of America's original boxing stars. He was an absolute monster, just as much he was an absolute sweetheart in the eyes of his fans. Robinson appeared in movies and commercials and in every address he gave, he seemed humble and kind.<h2>Out Of Control - Sonny Liston</h2>[caption id="attachment_717357" align="alignnone" width="1200"] <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sonny-liston-top.jpg alt width=1200 height=675 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> Via: Sports Illustrated[/caption]Sonny Liston isn't too well known and that's because most of his life is actually a mystery, including his actual age. Sonny Liston is most well known for being the man that Muhammad Ali beat to become Heavyweight champion. Sonny was deeply involved with the mob and it is rumoured that he was killed by them.<h2>Squeaky Clean - Lennox Lewis</h2>[caption id="attachment_721300" align="alignnone" width="2251"] <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TELEMMGLPICT000172786549_transAo1dO8B__BhUWvTd915Vcjz6f8NIl6Ole_RP6SDoP6A.jpeg alt width=2251 height=1408 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> Via: The Telegraph[/caption]Lennox Lewis is one of the most accomplished men in boxing, both inside and outside of the ring.

Mike admits that he wasn't mentally prepared for the success he would face. Mike would spend a lot of money on extravagant things, like literal tigers, and even received jail time for a bit.<h2>Squeaky Clean - Vasyl Lomachenko</h2>[caption id="attachment_717359" align="alignnone" width="1920"] <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vasyllomachenko-cropped_x8vwe8wb7f741b8uuhhyjmtmh.jpg alt width=1920 height=1080 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> Via: Sporting News[/caption]It seems that Vasyl Lomachenko's father, who is also his coach, had the idea that if his son had no amount of free time with extracurriculars, he wouldn't get into trouble. Well, he might have been right, as Vasyl seems to spend all of his time avoiding controversy by literally training&nbsp;every day. <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2>Out Of Control - Tyson Fury</h2>[caption id="attachment_717352" align="alignnone" width="1438"] <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000453295246-2-e1560098150754.jpg alt width=1438 height=2168 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> Via: The Sun[/caption]Tyson Fury's recent career resurgence is an amazing feat and everyone is happy that he was able to dig himself out of the deep depression that he was in. Before this, however, Fury was really out of control partying every night and consuming insane amounts of alcohol. It was so bad that Fury attempted to take his own life at one point and came close before stopping. <span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">16 Pics That Paint Tyson Fury In A Different Light</a></span><h2>Squeaky Clean - Gennady Golovkin</h2>[caption id="attachment_717344" align="alignnone" width="1200"] <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1033304086.jpg.0.jpg alt width=1200 height=800 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> Via: Bad Left Hook[/caption]Gennady Golovkin has become even more of a fan favorite ever since his mega-matches with Canelo Alvarez. While Canelo has become seen as a bit of a corporate sell-out in the eyes of many due to the insane judging of the first match, GGG came out of the match looking squeaky clean with fans falling in love with his goofy and humble personality. <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2>Out Of Control - Andy Ruiz</h2>[caption id="attachment_717345" align="alignnone" width="1920"] <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/AndyRuiz.jpg alt width=1920 height=1080 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> Via: Cali Sports News[/caption]Andy Ruiz was a bit of a nobody in the public eye before he had the upset of the year, defeating Heavyweight king Anthony Joshua by TKO.
