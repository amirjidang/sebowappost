Maybe they put on a few pounds, they're faces changed shape or they aged dramatically, but your brain just doesn't connect them with their former selves right away. Dramatic physical changes happen to plenty of people. Well, believe it or not, this type of thing happens to actors as well. We can pretend we don't notice such things because we are so much better than people who judge others on their physical appearances. To people like us, it's about what's inside that counts. But we're all friends here, so we can be honest with each other. These are only the things that you say out loud, aren't they? Inside you're judging the hell out of a person's looks. You make us sick, but we accept you in spite of your flaws.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now before you get back to puffing out your chest, arching your back and accidentally scraping your nose on the ceiling, please note that we're not saying that these actors got worse looking. We could say that, but we won't. We could say that some of them got really ugly, but that would be rude. We're simply saying you wouldn't recognize them anymore. They've changed. You might make the connection between change and ugliness, but that's your own problem. Many on the list have had extensive plastic surgery, some have illnesses and some just got different. With all that in mind, get ready to take a look at some actors and stars that you know, but you might not know you know them anymore because you don't know them by their new look.</p><p>Here are 15 Actors That You Wouldn't Even Recognize Anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-jerry-stiller><strong>15. Jerry Stiller</strong></h2><p>Today, <a href=#>Jerry Stiller</a> is 89 years old. We haven't seen him in years (with the exception of the very brief and difficult to see cameo in Zoolander 2), so he looks quite different&nbsp;from how we remember him from Seinfeld or King of Queens. Sadly, he recently lost his wife of 61 years, Anne Meara. Stiller still looks fantastic, fantastic but different. Maybe it's the white hair or maybe he's lost some weight. Whatever it is, it's not the same Jerry, but we're not mad. It's unlikely we see Stiller in anything else, at least not any time soon. He appears to have left the industry behind and has just been focusing on keeping healthy. Do you, Jerry. Do you.</p><h2 id=14-val-kilmer><strong>14. Val Kilmer</strong></h2><p>Who the hell knows what's going on with <a href=#>Val Kilmer</a> these days? First, <a href=#>Michael Douglas</a> came out and spoke about Kilmer, saying, “Val was a wonderful guy who is dealing with exactly what I had, and things don’t look too good for him.” The "what I had" was meant to be throat cancer, which Kilmer claims is not true. In response, he wrote, "Thank you all for your love and support. There’s a rumor I’m unwell again and in hospital which is totally untrue. I was in to verify I have no tumor or infection of any kind which was verified by the very caring experts at UCLA. Friends have assisted who know my spiritual convictions and have been most sensitive and kind for the extra effort in making sure there’s minimum gossip and silly talk." So, we don't know if Kilmer is sick or not, but we do know that he looks much different, much thinner and a little more puffy facey. Sick or not, we wish him the best of health.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-renee-zellweger><strong>13. Renee Zellweger</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Renee Zellweger</a> took a lot of abuse when she first revealed her new look in 2014. While most speculate that plastic surgery is the cause of the change, Zellweger has used the conversation as an opportunity to discuss why there is always a focus on the female image in Hollywood. She also suggested that the physical change in her looks is because of her emotional change. “I’m glad folks think I look different! I’m living a different, happy, more fulfilling life, and I’m thrilled that perhaps it shows,” Zellweger said. “My friends say that I look peaceful. I am healthy. For a long time I wasn’t doing such a good job with that. I took on a schedule that is not realistically sustainable and didn’t allow for taking care of myself. Rather than stopping to recalibrate, I kept running until I was depleted and made bad decisions about how to conceal the exhaustion. I was aware of the chaos and finally chose different things.” This is all pretty basic deflection, but maybe she's right. Maybe we shouldn't be talking about how plastic surgery has made her look completely different from what she used to look like.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-lil-kim><strong>12. Lil' Kim</strong></h2><p>We aren't doctors, so we won't try and put a name-tag on someone's issues, if you can even call it an issue, but people everywhere have been discussing the dramatic physical transformation of rapper and actress <a href=#>Lil' Kim</a>. From people saying that she's addicted to plastic surgery and/or skin bleaching or suffers from body dysmorphia or extreme self-esteem issues, everyone has the reason why she's been changing. Regardless of why, Lil' Kim has changed throughout the years. We can see it. For Lil', she's been thinking about her image for a long time. Even back in 2000, she said in an interview, “All my life men have told me I wasn’t pretty enough—even the men I was dating. And I’d be like, ‘Well, why are you with me, then?’” It’s always been men putting me down just like my dad. To this day when someone says I’m cute, I can’t see it. I don’t see it no matter what anybody says.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-jwoww><strong>11. JWoww</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Jennifer Lynn "JWoww" Farley</a> is known from Jersey Shore. She's done some other stuff too, but we refuse to believe that anyone watched Snooki & JWoww. It just wouldn’t be right. We knew, even back when we first met JWoww, that plastic surgery was kind of her thing. She looked good though. We expected it from her. Maybe in 20 years or so, when the signs of aging began to weaken her looks, we expected that she would try to fix it with surgery, but we never expected that she would start changing her face this soon. She's only 30 and she already looks like a completely different person than she did five years ago. We aren't saying the changes are worse, we're just not saying that they're better, not even close in fact.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-janice-dickinson><strong>10. Janice Dickinson</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Janice Dickinson</a> calls herself the "first supermodel" and she also says she's no stranger to plastic surgery. Over the last 30 years, Dickinson has done it all really. In that time, she's become something so different from what she started as that it's a challenge to mentally associate her as she is today with her former self. Since the 70s, Dickinson has been a familiar face to many who pay attention to models, but today she's turned into more of a reality television star. Still, it's not all bad. Dickinson, with her present-day looks, has become a warning against the harms of plastic surgery. Stars of today can look at her and see the end result of a lifetime of such frequent dabbling with cosmetic surgery. Because of her, young stars know the risks. Every time you go under the knife kids, you increase your chances of getting dickinson-ed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-pamela-anderson><strong>9. Pamela Anderson</strong></h2><p>We've seen <a href=#>Pamela Anderson</a> change before. There was the Anderson that first was discovered. She was pure and beautiful. Then there was megastar Pamela Anderson; there were changes, yeah, but many people loved it. She became a more dominant kind of sexy. Some people called it a trashier sexy. But now, after years of aging and probably a lot more work, Anderson is a third type of person. She's not better or worse looking; she's just different. Once again, though, we see that aging and plastic surgery never really work together. Obviously, there's enough people out there who love the way cosmetic surgery looks, but what the hell? When has anyone ever looked really great with plastic surgery over the age of 50? Who are the examples that all these celebrities are using to justify getting work done?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-priscilla-presley><strong>8. Priscilla Presley</strong></h2><p>We've watched <a href=#>Priscilla Presley</a> grow up from a very young age. It was always expected that she would change but we didn't expect it to happen the way it did. Even in the late 80s and early 90s, Presley was a bombshell. There was work that was done, but it wasn't enough to ruin the natural good looks that she had. Then, as we got into the new millennium, Presley just kept going with the cosmetic changes. They were drastic and they were awful. Even she admits that they ruined her face. They did. It's bad. It would have been nice to see her age properly, like a human. Oh well. We always have the Naked Gun films to look back on when we want to see Presley when she was a beautiful woman.</p><h2 id=7-daryl-hannah><strong>7. Daryl Hannah</strong></h2><p>Maybe it's because we've always latched onto the image of <a href=#>Daryl Hannah</a> as a young and beautiful woman or maybe because her work hasn't been as noticeable in the last decade or so, but people have suggested that Hannah's looks have severely deteriorated over time. There's been some work done on her face, for sure as well, some work that might not be the most natural-looking. If, 20 years ago, we would have said that Daryl Hannah would look worse in 20 years, people would have said, yeah, of course. So why then are we so shocked that it has happened that way?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-cary-elwes><strong>6. Cary Elwes</strong></h2><p>Actors like Cary Elwes, these stars who have massive hits from many years ago, age differently in our eyes than most. We have a permanent image of them etched in our minds, maybe it's from 30 years ago in Princess Bride or maybe it's from Robin Hood: Men in Tights. This is how we see Elwes, so when we see him in the present day, it surprises us. This isn’t how we know you. This isn’t the way you should look. Unfortunately, age doesn’t wait for anyone, not even one-time handsome stars. It's not that Elwes is no longer handsome, he is; he's just a different kind of handsome, a rounder, older kind of handsome.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-john-travolta><strong>5. John Travolta</strong></h2><p><a href=#>John Travolta's</a> face has been a topic of discussion for some time. It really escalated when we saw him at the Oscars a couple of years back looking like he'd be frozen in wax. This past year, in The People V OJ Simpson, though, people everywhere took to commenting about Travolta's new look. This new look was a strange one. Most struggled to put words to exactly what it was about him that was changed. There was a tan, yeah, excessive Botox, no doubt, but it was more than that. Travolta has been changed, completely. This is probably just the beginning too. Travolta is travelling a slippery slope that will end in a complete transformation. Just wait. Ten years from now, Travolta will basically be a robot. There's an argument to be made that he already is.</p><h2 id=4-edward-furlong><strong>4. Edward Furlong</strong></h2><p>Child stars change the most over time. This is obvious, but we still take notice and make comments about it when it happens. <a href=#>Edward Furlong</a> isn’t the spry young kid we remember from the Terminator franchise, so we talk about it. He's aged, puffed up a bit, and looks a bit sloppy. Plenty of people mock his current look, suggesting he has become something he doesn't want to be. Maybe he likes the way he looks or maybe he just doesn't care one bit. He probably gave up on the possibility of aging like George Clooney long ago. That kind of look wasn't in the cards for him, so he just went with the flow, and his kind of flow is a homeless-looking flow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-lara-flynn-boyle><strong>3. Lara Flynn Boyle</strong></h2><p>We've known <a href=#>Lara Flynn Boyle</a> since the 80s. She was a sex symbol from the start and she would only get better. In the early 2000s, we saw the early signs of cosmetic work in Flynn Boyle, but it was subtle and it wasn't all that bad. Her lips were fuller and there was probably some other work too, but she still looked the same, generally. A few years later, she got more work done. Her lips became even fuller and the features on her face even sharper. Then it just continued to get worse and Flynn Boyle stopped working, so we barely ever saw her. Many of us even forgot about her. That made it weird when we saw what she looks like now. It freaked us out. She can't be the same person, can she? WTF. These are some of the things we thought.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2-david-letterman><strong>2. David Letterman</strong></h2><p>It seemed like <a href=#>David Letterman</a> had only been gone from the spotlight for a little while before we got photos of him looking like a caveman. Maybe seeing Letterman on the same show for over 30 years, and really seeing him look the exact same for the vast majority of that time, seared an image of him in our brains. When we first saw him in his madman outfit, post-retirement, jogging or hunting or whatever it was that he was doing, it caused us quite a fright. What is this beast that's been loosed on the world? We asked ourselves. It's not just the beard either. There's something new in his eyes. This is a changed man we're seeing. It's like he just doesn't give a damn. He's rich. He's been polite long enough. Now he'll just bite into a deer carcass lying on the side of the road if he wants to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-shelley-duvall><strong>1. Shelley Duvall</strong></h2><p>You would remember <a href=#>Shelley Duvall</a> best from her turns in The Shining and Popeye, but if you haven’t seen her in years, like most of us, you might be shocked that she looks so different. Reports first came out in late 2016 that Duvall was unwell and appeared to suffering from mental illness. Dr. Phil, as he tends to do, jumped on this and got her to appear on his show, turning her delusions of seeing <a href=#>Robin Williams</a> visions and others into entertainment. Thankfully, the Actor Fund reached out to Duvall after seeing her on that terrible show to see if they could help her, rather than letting Dr. Phil diagnose her illness with a bunch of Southern metaphors that make no sense.</p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Wikipedia</a>, <a href=#>IMDB</a>; <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>; <a href=#>Daily Mail</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2WsLW70axkraCRqXq6u9RmrqitnJm7tXnEr5ynZaKasLCzzaKxnmWRo8auu9GeZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./15-actors-who-got-their-start-in-small-roles.html>&#171;&nbsp;15 Actors Who Got Their Start in Small Roles</a>
