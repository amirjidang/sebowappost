bringing the <a href=#>Marvel Cinematic Universe’s</a> Hany Pym to life in the Ant-Man movies. While that makes sense, since the MCU is the highest-grossing film franchise in history, it is also a shame. After all, Douglas had already cemented his legacy as a Hollywood legend by the time he joined the MCU.</p><p>Since the ‘80s, Michael Douglas has been a major star because he headlined movies like Romancing the Stone, Wall Street,Fatal Attraction, <a href=#>Basic Instinct </a><a href=#>(with Sharon Stone)</a> and The Game, among others. As a result of all the success he has enjoyed, Douglas is a very rich man. In fact, Douglas and his longtime wife Catherine Zeta-Jones are among the wealthiest couples in Hollywood.

With those figures in mind, it should go without saying that the two Hollywood heavyweights can afford to live in luxury. Still, when looking at the real estate that Douglas and Zeta-Jones have bought and sold over the years, the numbers are mind-blowing.</p><p>Ever since Douglas became a massive movie star, he has seen the value in purchasing real estate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For proof of that, all you have to look at is the fact that Douglas and his first wife Diandra Luker bought a 250-acre estate on the coast of Spain called S'Estaca in 1990. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Purchased for $3.5 million at the time</a>, the estate is worth far more than that today. After Douglas and Luker got divorced, he was forced to buy the property a second time. The reason for that is that Douglas and Luker shared the property for years but because he felt uncomfortable with that arrangement, Douglas bought his ex-wife out in 2020. While talking about his decision to buy his ex-wife out, Michael explained that he wanted to leave the island property behind to his kids.</p><p>On top of Michael Douglas’ Spanish property, he has made a lot of other real estate purchases. For example, as of 2019, Douglas and his wife Catherine Zeta-Jones have lived in a Westchester mansion they bought for $4.5 million. Said to contain an amazing 22 different rooms, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the three-story home is reportedly 11,653-square-feet in size</a>. Other features of the mansion include a two-story wood-paneled library with a fireplace, a master bedroom with a dressing room, and a bathroom with its own fireplace.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When most people think about what they would buy if they won the lottery, purchasing a huge home is what comes to mind first and foremost. However, for stars of Michael and Catherine's stature, there are other elements of living in luxury. For example, according to a 2021 Forbes article, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Douglas has been traveling by private jet since the ‘70s</a> so he can enjoy places like CASA DE CAMPO Resort & Villas.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/michael-douglas-and-catherine-zeta-jones-changed-their-lives-for-their-daughter-carys-zeta-douglas-who-still-left-them-anyway.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Michael Douglas And Catherine Zeta-Jones Changed Their Lives For Their Daughter Carys Who Still Left Them Anyway">Michael Douglas And Catherine Zeta-Jones Changed Their Lives For Their Daughter Carys Who Still Left Them Anyway</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones moved for their daughter only to have her quickly move out anyway.</p><h2 id=did-michael-douglas-inherit-kirk-douglas-39-net-worth>Did Michael Douglas Inherit Kirk Douglas' Net Worth?</h2><h3 id=kirk-douglas-39-61-million-net-worth-did-not-go-to-michael-douglas>Kirk Douglas' $61 Million Net Worth Did Not Go To Michael Douglas</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/screen-shot-2023-12-17-at-10-53-48-am.png><p>During his lifetime, award-winning actor, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kirk Douglas was worth $61 million</a> when he passed away. However, none of the money ended up going to Michael or Catherine upon his death. Despite being exceptionally close to his son and daughter-in-law, he knew they had made more than enough money for themselves and therefore didn't need the financial legacy he had built throughout his career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Instead, all of Kirk's net worth was divided up and donated to various charitable causes.</strong></p><h2 id=which-charities-does-michael-douglas-support>Which Charities Does Michael Douglas Support?</h2><h3 id=michael-douglas-and-catherine-zeta-jones-support-at-least-23-charities>Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones Support At Least 23 Charities</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/catherine-zeta-jones-and-michael-douglas-early-in-their-relationship.jpg><p>Long before Michael Douglas became an acting superstar, his father Kirk Douglas took Hollywood by storm. Thanks to his roles in movies like Spartacus, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, and Paths of Glory, among others, <strong>Kirk Douglas was quite wealthy by the time he passed away at the age 103 in 2020.</strong> However, if anyone expected Kirk’s son to add a lot of money to his net worth following his famous father’s passing, that wasn’t what happened. Instead, years after he founded the Douglas Foundation with his wife Anne, <a href=#>Kirk left his estate to the charity</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the fact that he was raised by two parents who valued helping those in need, it shouldn’t surprise anyone that Michael Douglas has spent a fortune to help a slew of charities. Even still, it is pretty impressive to learn that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Douglas reportedly supports at least 23 different charities and foundations</a> according to looktothestars.org.</p><p>When looking at the array of charities that Michael Douglas supports, it is clear that he wants to help people fight disease. After all, Douglas has donated his time and money to charities like the Elton John AIDS Foundation, Stand Up To Cancer, and the American Foundation for AIDS Research. Douglas also prioritizes helping kids through his support of charities like UNICEF, Starlight Children's Foundation, and Free The Children. It also is worth noting that on top of donating to the Ploughshares Fund which seeks to reduce the world’s nuclear weapons stockpiles, he serves on its Board of Directors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydoJ1lnZ6wqa3EpWSdp6WcuaK%2FjKKloZ2insFuusStZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./how-old-is-nick-davis-age-wikipedia-everything-on-seeking-sister-wife-cast.html>&#171;&nbsp;How Old Is Nick Davis?
