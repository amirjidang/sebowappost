I love watching them. And I couldn’t step into that role. How you become more aware of time, and you’ve had more experience, good and bad, with people,” he notes. “And your own wins and losses — the older you get, they don’t seem like so much of a win or so much of a loss. Who you spend your times with, how you spend time — it has just become much more important to me.”</p><p>He's had a lot of ups and downs, both in and out of the business, we can safely say he’s living the ups these days. However, he did have some questionable past experiences – like let’s say just say a certain role on a sitcom, one that was out of Brad’s wheelhouse, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends</a>. Was he forced into the gig? And heck, how comfortable was he with the role in front of a live audience? The answer might surprise fans, even the best actors fumble in different circumstances, Pitt included!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pitt-hesitated-to-accept-given-his-lack-of-experience>Pitt Hesitated To Accept Given His Lack Of Experience</h2><p>The creator of the show David Crane opened up with MSN, discussing the celeb’s cameo – Crane was overjoyed with the decision, though he made a surprising revelation. According to Crane, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pitt hesitated to accept</a> given his lack of experience in front of a live audience;</p><p>“I think [there was] a little bit [of hesitation],” the show’s creator, David Crane, told Hollywood Life EXCLUSIVELY at the AT&T 5G Friends Fan Experience. “Only because he’d never done TV in front of an audience, and it’s a very specific skill set. I think it’s probably a little intimidating if you haven’t done it before. Obviously, it was up to him, and it was up to [Jennifer], and it was just a great piece of casting,” he revealed. “When he said yes, we were thrilled.”</p><p>It all worked out in the end – however, the nerves would eventually kick in once he made his way on the show, taking on the role of Will, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ross’ </a>high school buddy.

Pitt had some nerves, though he loved the dynamic of the cast, who loved to laugh and have a good time with one another.</p><p>He took part in the iconic "Thanksgiving" episode, which was always a classic throughout the show’s history. It didn’t start too well, as Pitt admitted to messing up his first line and causing a reshoot;</p><p>"I remember it. It's a great cast, man. I mean, they laugh and really have a great time with each other. But I flubbed my first line," the 55-year-old actor told Access Hollywood, as cited by Us Weekly. "We had to stop and start again."</p><p>Not the ideal way to start off your cameo – however, Pitt was able to bounce back and he was more than iconic in the role – feuding with his real-life partner at the time, Jennifer Aniston.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, how did the gig come about, and was Jen influential?

He was a big fan of the show and he decided to keep his presence on the DL each time, at least until he finally appeared for the cameo.</p><p>Although Jen was important, it was a great time to also promote his new film Spy Game, which was releasing at the time. It was a double win for Brad, getting to appear on a show he loved alongside his former partner, not to mention getting to promote his film on such a prime-time network and show.</p><p>The episode remains among the more iconic of all-time, most fans would’ve wished for a longer cameo but we’re thankful that it took place altogether.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In summary, Brad was the one behind the decision ultimately, choosing to put his nerves aside for the role!
