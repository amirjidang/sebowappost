strange ticks, but one of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the most surprising things about him</a> is that he sends&nbsp;holiday cakes to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a select group of celebrity friends</a> annually, and he's been doing it for a couple of decades. No wonder he has so many close friends and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his co-stars love working with him.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sending these luxurious cakes every year, to a group of people no less, doesn't just remind everyone that Cruise is caring. It reminds everyone, recipient or not, that Cruise is absolutely minted. It turns out he doesn't just spend his millions (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he's worth a whopping $600 million</a>) on Scientology, child support for Suri, really huge compounds, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">movies filmed in space</a>.</p><p>With <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his Mission Impossible salary</a> alone, we don't think a couple of cakes would break Cruise's bank. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He's the highest-paid actor per word</a> and the biggest confectionary buyer in the world. But who's a part of the lucky group that gets these little sugary wonders?</p><h2 id=the-cake-in-question>The Cake In Question</h2><p>The reasoning behind the cakes stems from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cruise's own sugar-ban</a>. Since he doesn't consume sugar, even though he loves it, while training for big blockbusters like Mission Impossible, he figured he'd send all of his friends a sugary treat instead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2018, Cruise told James Corden (who's also a recipient),&nbsp;"I send [cakes] to everyone... and I wait for the calls. I’m like: Tell me about it."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Cruise’s 5 Closest Friends (& 5 Celebs He Avoids)</a></span></p><p>Corden got a chocolate cake delivered the morning before he hosted the Grammys. The card wished him luck. "I was like, 'This is how you look so good. You make everyone else around you fat!"</p><p>The "Cruise Cake," as Kirsten Dunst dubbed it, is&nbsp;a White Chocolate Coconut Bundt Cake (even though Corden got chocolate) from Doan’s Bakery,&nbsp;a family-run business in Woodland Hills, California. They've been making the cake, which is frosted in cream cheese frosting and dusted with toasted coconut flakes, for a quarter of a century.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The matriarch of the bakery, the owner, Eric Doan's mother, started making them when they opened in 1984. "It’s just a unique cake that we dreamt up 25 years ago and we’ve always done it for different cafes, restaurants, and caterers." The bakery is largely a wholesale business that ships through Goldbelly for $99, but you can get it at the bakery for $50.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why Katie Holmes Refused To Leave Her House After Her And Tom Cruise Split</a></span></p><p>Cruise wasn't the first celebrity to gift Doan's bakery goods. Diane Keaton was first. When Keaton and Cruise's then-wife Katie Holmes wanted a cake on the set of Mad Money, they ordered from each of their favorite bakeries to see which cake was best. Cruise was the judge and liked Keaton's, which turned out to be the bundt cake.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Strangely enough, Cruise's never even met the Doan's. They're ordered, packaged in the fancy wrappings at another site, and sent out. That's it.</p><p>Even though Cruise hasn't met the Doan's, they still send him thank yous for his continued support. They didn't know how they were going to survive through the pandemic, but Cruise "kept us in business," Doan said.</p><p>Billy Bush even went to the bakery to see what the fascination was with the cake. He tried it and loved it of course.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=there-have-been-murmurings-of-the-cakes-for-years>There Have Been Murmurings Of The Cakes For Years</h2><p>The few who are privileged enough to receive the cakes have let slip of their nature over the years. They ask each other in hushed tones, "Are you on the cake list?" The way they talked about them, it's like this cake alone came down from confectionary heaven.</p><p>Forget becoming an EGOT, all celebrities care about is getting on the coveted cake list. Whenever Christmas rolls near, the recipients hope and pray they're still on the list to receive one.&nbsp;You obviously have to have such a profound effect on Cruise to make him put you on the list. Let's just say that Leah Remini is definitely not on there.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Are Tom Cruise And Nicole Kidman's Adopted Kids Doing Today?</a></span></p><p>One thing that's clear across the board though: the cakes are delicious, and have become a Christmas tradition that is loved by all.</p><p>Rosie O'Donnell says that the official start to Christmas is when she receives her cake in the mail from "Tommy."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kirsten Dunst started getting one every year after she co-starred with Cruise in Interview with the Vampire when she was eleven. She told Graham Norton that "it's the best coconut cake I've ever had in my life," and that her family goes crazy when it's delivered. "It's a major thing."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Renee Zellweger went on the Graham Norton Show, he asked her if she was still "on the cake list." She was Cruise's co-star on Jerry Maguire. Funny enough, Norton is also on the list, but he didn't know because his staff had been eating it every year without telling him. Apparently, Cruise also sent&nbsp;Louis Theroux’s grandmother 100 cupcakes when she turned 100 as well.</p><p>Jimmy Fallon calls&nbsp;the cake&nbsp;"unbelievable," while Henry Cavill describes it as "the most decadent, the most amazing." Barbara Walters ate hers on love television while hosting The View, and her co-hosts, Whoopi Goldberg, Sherri Shepherd, and Jenny McCarthy, all revealed they're also on the list of recipients.</p><p>Cobie Smulders, his Jack Reacher co-star, calls it "Tom Cruise deliciousness."&nbsp;She keeps hers frozen and slowly eats the cake throughout the year. She told Fallon it'll be a dark day if she ever falls off Cruise’s cake list.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other recipients include Angela Bassett, also a co-star, and Dakota and Elle Fanning. But there are probably hundreds more.</p><p>The Guardian wrote that by sending these cakes, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cruise is sending a message to the world</a>, and if we could all&nbsp;use&nbsp;our infinite wealth to package cakes to send to people, then&nbsp;"the world would undoubtedly be a better place." Say what you will about Cruise, he's one of the most generous celebrities in Hollywood, spreading joy one cake at a time.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Was Tom Cruise Used As The Inspiration Behind This Disney Prince?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tM5mnp6so2Kubq7Iq6uhnJGueqStyp5kn6qfonq1u8xmmqutmaiybrHVnqmyZamarrN7</p></div><div id=links><a href=./heres-why-the-self-aware-tone-of-josie-the-pussycats-made-it-a-purrrrfect-sleeper-hit.html>&#171;&nbsp;Here's Why The Self-Aware Tone Of 'Josie &amp;amp; The Pussycats' Made It A 'Purrrrfect' Sleeper Hit</a>
