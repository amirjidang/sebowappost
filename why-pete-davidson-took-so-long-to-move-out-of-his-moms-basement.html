In addition to his success as a comic, the star has also made headlines for his various romance, including his time spent with former fiancé, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Ariana Grande</strong></a>.</p><p>Well, Pete is making headlines again, but for a totally different reason! After residing in his mom's basement for 27-years, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">with whom he's very close</a>, the actor has finally packed. While he's poked fun at his living situation in the past, it was only a matter of time before he would move out, and here's why it took so long!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>What Did Ariana Grande Do With Her Engagement Ring From Pete Davidson?</a></span></p><h2 id=pete-davidson-moves-out>Pete Davidson Moves Out!</h2><p>Pete Davidson is no stranger to the limelight and he's now finding himself making headlines after the actor and comedian officially moved out of his mom's basement!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The star has openly discussed his living arrangements before, claiming that the house he and his mom went in on in Staten Island, New York had a pretty rad basement that he went on to use as his own pad.</p><p>While it was technically his house too, as the two split the purchase, Pete made it clear his intentions weren't to always stay at home for so long, even though it has allowed him to become closer to his mom, Amy Waters.</p><p>The two dished out a whopping $1.3 million for the home, which will obviously remain in Amy's hands moving forward.

"I just moved out of my mom's house. I'm fully out. I got a pad," he said.</p><p>The star came to the decision this past Valentine's day when being alone at home with his mom was a situation he didn't want to be in any longer. "I spent the night eating chocolate and watching a movie with my mom, which is why I'm officially moving out of the house. One of us has to go."</p><p>The actor is also rumored to be dating Bridgerton star, Phoebe Dynevor, so living alone will certainly make dating much easier for the star moving forward.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>An Inside Look Into Pete Davidson And John Mulaney's Enduring Friendship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdpbK1sYydmK%2BhlKi8r3nTqKakZaOkeq27zaBkraddory3sYyorK1ln5t6qbXSZqSopaNir6K%2FxKacp6xf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./zero-contact-actress-juliet-sorci-and-her-husband-ian-duncan-have-a-daughter-together-2.html>&#171;&nbsp;Zero Contact Actress Juliet Sorci And Her Husband Ian Duncan Have A Daughter Together</a>
