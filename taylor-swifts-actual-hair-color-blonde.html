Along with wanting to know about her romances, favorite hobbies and her workout and skincare plan, some are interested in the actual color of Swift's gorgeous (usually) golden locks, her multiple hairstyle changes over the years, and how her ever-evolving looks might relate to her growth as a person and artist.</p><p>Like other natural blondes, as Swift has gotten older, the natural shade of her hair has darkened.

Around 2010, she appeared with a darker shade of blonde, and her coils had straightened. The Cruel Summer singer could often be seen wearing bright red lipstick, now one of her signature looks. After her copper color, in 2017 she made a switch to platinum blonde, but it seems <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift thought the color was a miss</a>, according to ShowBizCheatSheet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We very much wanted to give Taylor a new look.

Swift paired her bleached hair with incredibly dark lipstick for the 2016 Met Gala, and stayed platinum blonde for Coachella.</p><p>The Shake It Off singer told Elle how she felt about the color. "Fashion is all about playful experimentation. If you don't look back at pictures of some of your old looks and cringe, you're doing it wrong. See: Bleachella."</p><p>Her blonde hair has been golden, copper, ash blonde, platinum and Swift has reportedly highlighted and layered her blonde hair to provide depth and texture to her luscious locks. She's also experimented with pastel colors, including pink and blue at different times amid her golden waves. Swift has gone back to her lengthy golden locks in recent years, and still impresses many with changes she makes for videos and performances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/the-eras-tour-taylor-swift-s-most-memorable-off-script-moments-so-far-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Eras Tour: Taylor Swift’s Most Memorable Off-Script Moments (So Far)</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's Eras Tour has been memorable for many reasons, but not everything has gone according to plan at every show...</span><p>Swift has shown off multiple hairstyles throughout her career.
