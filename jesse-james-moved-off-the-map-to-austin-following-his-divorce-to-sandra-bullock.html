However, in 2010, the year Sandra Bullock took home an Oscar for The Blindside, their marriage came to an end after five years. Infidelity was the reasoning, as <a href=#>several women stepped up and admitted to having a relationship with Jesse James.</a></p><p>To James' credit, he admitted to his wrongdoings.</p><p>“Yeah, I did cheat on my wife, yeah,” James told the website. “I stood up and took accountability for it and apologized.

At the time, James made mention that he was in it for the long-run, finally finding his person.</p><p>“We like the same stuff, the same music, the same everything. We like all these things. It makes me look back at other relationships and be like, I was an idiot! What was I thinking? That was never going to work. But I guess that’s how you learn, you know.”</p><p>However, like his other relationships, his time with DeJoria recently came to an end, with infidelity once again as the cause for the divorce.

"How do you process grief and not hurt your child in the process? It's a newborn. They take on everything that you're feeling. So my obligation was to him and not tainting the first year of his life with my grief."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bullock has kept her personal life very quiet in the recent years.
