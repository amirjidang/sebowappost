film. From unbelievably restrictive diets to intense workout routines, if any actor knows what it takes to get in shape for a movie, it's <a href=#>Sylvester Stallone.</a> Beginning his professional acting career in 1968, Stallone has over five decades of experience in the film industry and has worked with numerous exceptionally talented celebrities in Hollywood, such as Sandra Bullock, Alan Cumming, Jason Momoa, <a href=#>Jason Statham</a>, Wesley Snipes, Sharon Stone, Jet Li, and Michael B. Jordan. That's only scratching the service when talking about Stallone's long-winded resume. At 75-years old, the man who turned Rocky Balboa into an immortalized icon is still hitting the big screen. Here are 10 heavy-hitting box office movies by Sylvester Stallone.</p><h2 id=guardians-of-the-galaxy-2>Guardians Of The Galaxy 2</h2><p>Over the years, fans have witnessed Stallone acting as a police detective, a tenacious boxer, the leader of a group of mercenaries, but seeing him act like a superhero in Guardian of The Galaxy 2 would be a first for many. While the lead star of the Marvel Studios movie series is<a href=#> Chris Pratt</a> (Star-Lord), Stallone steals the spotlight temporarily in Guardians of The Galaxy 2 when he appears as Starhawk. His character is an anti-hero and is destined to relive his life many times in the Marvel Universe. Stallone was cast opposite many characters such as Kurt Russell, Dave Bautista, and Zoe Saldana. Coming in at number one on the list., <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Guardians of the Galaxy 2</a>&nbsp;grossed $869.11 million at the international box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-expendables-2>The Expendables 2</h2><p>Returning to the typical tough-guy persona, Stallone reprised his role as Barney Ross in the macho action-comedy,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> The Expendables 2.</a> Released in 2012, the film follows a return of most of the mercenary team, including Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), and Mr. Church (<a href=#>Bruce Willis</a>). After Mr. Church commissions the team to retrieve an item from a plane crash in Albania, only to be intercepted by the criminal arms dealer, Vilain (Jean-Claude Van Damme) and his group, the Sangs. They have captured Billy the Kid (Liam Hemsworth) and ultimately kill him. Ross swears vengeance on Vilain for BIlly's death. Only the second installment of The Expendables franchise, the film grossed $311.97 million at the global box office.</p><h2 id=rambo-first-blood-part-2>Rambo: First Blood Part 2</h2><p>Sylvester Stallone has been smashing box office numbers for more than a few years now. It seems that he's been an in-demand actor ever since he made his way into Hollywood, and it's evident with his return to the big screen in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rambo: First Blood Part II</a> in 1985. Aside from Rocky Balboa, <a href=#>John Rambo</a> is most likely Stallone's most celebrated movie character. When Rambo's former captain, Col. Troutman (Richard Crenna) offers Rambo a deal to travel to Vietnam in search of American prisoners of war in exchange for a clean slate on his criminal record and freedom from jail, he accepts. But he must keep his hands from any bloodshed. Rambo quickly goes back on his word when he learns that his lover, Co Bao (Julia Nickson) is killed by <a href=#>Vietnamese forces</a>, and begins executing every soldier sent to disarm him. Due to its high-action intensity and emotional charge, the film grossed a whopping $300.4 million internationally.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rocky-iv>Rocky IV</h2><p>If there's ever a movie that encapsulates true grit, determination, courage, and loyalty, it's Rocky IV. Sylvester Stallone reprised his famous character, Rocky Balboa, in 1985 for another epic sports action film that only he could bring to life. In this installment, Rocky is planning to retire and enjoy life with his wife, Talia Shire. But there's a change of plans when a ruthless Russian boxer named Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) beats Apollo Creed (<a href=#>Carl Weathers</a>), Rocky's friend and former opponent, to death in the ring. Rocky swears to avenge to friend's death by scheduling a fight in Russia to take on Drago. The movie grossed a total of $300.37 at the box office globally.</p><h2 id=the-expendables>The Expendables</h2><p>This is where the journey for The Expendables begins. Released in 2010, the movie featured much of the same cast of characters, including Dan Paine (Steve Austin), Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), and Hale Caesar (Terry Cruz). After receiving a contract mission to take out a tyrannical dictator named General Garza in the Gulf of Mexico, he is made aware that the General is just a pawn. The real target is now a rival C.I.A. operative, James Munroe (<a href=#>Eric Roberts</a>), who has gone rogue. Munrow has now joined forces with Garza and wants to keep money and drugs for himself. The Expendables amassed $268 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cliffhanger>Cliffhanger</h2><p>Just when you think you've seen Sly do all there is to do as an actor, he surprises the world in 1993 with his role as a professional mountain climber in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cliffhanger</a>. By this time Stallone had been acting for 25 years professionally and was looking to shock the world again with his presence on screen. He plays the role of Gabe Walker, an <a href=#>adrenaline junkie</a> and former mountain rescuer who is tricked into helping a group of stranded hikers after their plane goes down. He soon finds out that they're in fact a group of robbers who've lost $100 million and are in desperate need of its location. The cast also included John Lithgow, Janine Turner, and Michael Rooker and reached a height of $255 million at the box office.</p><h2 id=rocky>Rocky</h2><p>Still very early in his career, Stallone was chosen for the role of Rocky Balboa in the 1976 sport/drama, Rocky; a role that would lead to a super-successful movie franchise for years to come. Rocky is introduced as a small-time boxer from Philidelphia who, prior to being chosen as a replacement to fight the rough and tough reigning<a href=#> heavyweight champion</a>, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), was largely unknown in the boxing world. In order to condition his mind and body for the boxing battle, he trains intensely with former bantamwieght boxer, Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith). It's at this time that he begins a relationship with Adrian Pennino (Talia Shire) who would later become his wife. The film grossed a whopping $225 million at the box office, which is excellent for a first-time film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Sylvester Stallone Auctions Off Items From 'Rambo' And 'Rocky'</a></span></p><h2 id=creed-2>Creed 2</h2><p>Released in 2018, Creed 2 is the second installment of Creed, which was released in 2015, grossing significantly less than the sequel. The movie focuses on Adonis Johnson (<a href=#>Michael B. Jordan</a>), the son of Apollo Creed, who Rocky takes under his wing as his official coach, seeing that the young man is born and bred for boxing. The ultimate showdown of the protoges ensues when Adonis accepts a challenge from Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu), the son of Ivan Drago - the man who killed Adonis' father in the ring. Reluctantly, Balboa helps train Adonis for his date with destiny and change the course of his legacy once and for all. Compared ot 2015's Creed, which grossed $173.6 million,<a href=#> Creed 2</a> exceeded expectations and grossed $213.5 million internationally.</p><h2 id=the-expendables-3>The Expendables 3</h2><p>While rumours of an Expendables 4 remain in anticipation to be released in 2022, the last installment of 2014, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Expendables 3</a>, is the last action-packed movie series Stallone has given fans to enjoy. In this installment, Barney Ross is forced to face the past by going to war with the partner-turned-arms dealer he thought he killed, Conrad Stonebanks (<a href=#>Mel Gibson</a>). Stonebanks has vowed to put a complete end to The Expendables. So, in order to combat him effectively, Ross gathers a team of young blood who are stronger, faster, and more technologically savvy, which include Smilee (Kellan Lutz), Thorn (Glen Powell), Mars (<a href=#>Victor Ortiz</a>), and Camilla (Sarai Givaty), along with the original team of soldiers. Despite grossing the least of all three movie installments, The Expendables 3 raked in $209.4 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rambo-3>Rambo 3</h2><p>Young, strong, and in the prime of his career, Stallone reprised his rose as John Rambo yet again the 1988 war movie, Rambo 3. The incredibly elusive and unpredictably dangerous Rambo is situated in <a href=#>Thailand </a>when he receives a visit from his longtime comrade, Col. Sam Trautman (Richard Crenna). Trautman seeks the elite skill of Rambo for a CIA-funded mercenary team he is putting together to supply the Mujahideen and other Islamic guerilla groups with weapons to fight against the Soviet Army. But when Rambo decline the invite, Trautman goes alone and is ambushed by Soviet forces and taken for intertogation (torture) by Colenel Alexei Zaysen (Marc de Jonge). Upon hearing the news, Rambo decides to help in rescuing his friend. Against a budget of $63 million, the film more than doubled its box office grossing to $188.7 million.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>The Rocky Garage: 12 Cars In Sylvester Stallone's Splendid Collection</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ScreenRant</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Empire Online</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Roger Ebert</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Atlantic</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS%2FsK%2FKsmSroZOdsrR5kGlkoaGXnbK0wIygqairo567qHnBqK9mp5abtqSxjKamr6GVqHqwsoyssKWulajBpr6MrKuapJyku6Z7</p></div><div id=links><a href=./12-actors-that-could-play-spider-man-after-andrew-garfield.html>&#171;&nbsp;12 Actors That Could Play Spider-Man After Andrew Garfield</a>
