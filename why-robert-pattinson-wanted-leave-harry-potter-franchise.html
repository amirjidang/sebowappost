I remember the first scene I ever shot was in the magical maze at the end, and I’d never done anything with special effects and stunts. And it was a big deal at the time. It felt very, very, intimidating.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Critics Say There's One Big Problem With The 'Twilight' Franchise</a></span></p><p>Of course, Pattinson would go on to film the entire Twilight franchise with the use of stunts and special effects. But at the time, the experience was new to him, so he read books on method acting to help him prepare for the role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“The only thing I really got out of that was just beating yourself up before every single scene,” he said of what he learned in the book. “That was basically my only concept of how to prepare for a scene. I was psyching myself up as if I was getting into a fight or something before these scenes, and just screaming into a pillow and fighting, punching myself, and kind of ripping my clothing and stuff.”</p><p>He went on, “But I had all these prosthetic wounds on, and all of the prosthetics would melt off my face, and I’d have to have all of my makeup done again. But I had no concept of how to kind of get into a psyched-up physical state.”</p><h2 id=how-much-money-did-robert-pattinson-make-from-harry-potter>How Much Money Did Robert Pattinson Make From Harry Potter?</h2><p>Even though Harry Potter proved to be a challenge for Pattinson, it seems as if the experience literally paid off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I spent a lot of time living off the Harry Potter money,” he told GQ. “I moved to an apartment in Soho in London.”</p><p>Pattinson explained that after Harry Potter, he turned his attention to music and focused on doing open mic nights and gigs around London. Eventually, though, he ran out of money. “I was definitely going in the wrong direction in terms of a career, up until Twilight.”</p><p>Of course, <a href=#>Pattinson reportedly didn’t seriously increase his net worth until Twilight,</a> which was a game-changer.</p><h2 id=why-robert-pattinson-didn-rsquo-t-want-to-say-in-the-harry-potter-franchise>Why Robert Pattinson Didn’t Want To Say In The Harry Potter Franchise</h2><p>In an interview with Games Radar, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Pattinson admitted that he didn’t want to stay in the Harry Potter franchise</a> from the long-term, but not for reasons that fans may think.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He revealed in the interview, which was given while Pattinson was still in the midst of working on the Twilight franchise, that he believed it would be easier to complete all the Twilight films than it would be to complete all the Harry Potter films.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What The Cast Of 'Twilight' Really Thought About Renesmee</a></span></p><p>"The Harry Potter I worked on was an 11 month shoot.

Whereas Rob was suddenly the most famous guy in the world. I think that’s a lot harder to deal with.”</p><p>Even though Pattinson couldn’t have imagined himself staying in the Harry Potter franchise for more than one movie, he did enjoy his time making The Goblet of Fire: “It was a really nice environment on Harry Potter. Even compared to movies I’ve done since, it was very protected, the way the kids were treated.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Fans React To Rumours Of Emma Watson Quitting Acting</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdp7yjsdGtZKmZpKm2r7%2FOp2SwmZ6psqV5y56Yr51dna6zvthmp6ispJq%2FbrLRmqWcoJmosnA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./sam-altman-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>&#171;&nbsp;Sam Altman Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a>
