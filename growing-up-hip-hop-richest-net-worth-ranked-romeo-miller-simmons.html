Today, she is by far the wealthiest cast member on the show with an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated net worth of $37 million.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Is TWitch’s Wife Allison Holker, And What Does She Do For A Living?</a></span></p><h2 id=tj-mizell---9-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>TJ Mizell - $9 Million</span></h2><p>One look at TJ Mizell and you can probably tell what legend he is related to, but if you can’t, it’s the legendary DJ, Jam Master Jay. He was known for being a member of the iconic group, Run D.M.C. Now, just like his father, Mizell has built a name for himself in the industry. While his success landed him a job on ASAP FERG’s tour DJ, it has also helped start his own record label, among several other involvements. Together these ventures have earned him a<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> net worth of $9 million.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vanessa-simmons---9-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Vanessa Simmons - $9 Million</span></h2><p>Vanessa Simmons, daughter of Rev Run, is currently one of the biggest stars on the show, ant it's all thanks to her acting career. Most of her recognition is for her theatrical talents, which have landed her spots on several movies and television projects. Some of her most prominent bodies of works include Talking with the Taxman About Poetry, Hollywood Chaos, as well an appearance on The Steve Harvey Show. Vanessa has ties to several income streams besides her career, one of which involves several endorsement deals.

While all of these earn her quite a stack of cash, she also has a large social media following and occasionally collaborates with other brands which of course pay her well.

However, these days, Miller has been pulling his weight, both as a rapper and an actor. From his award shelf, it’s alright to say that he has been doing very well in both lines of work. As a famous rapper, he landed several deals, but his addition of acting to the mix just put more money in his pocket. Now, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the superstar has been estimated to be worth $5 million.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Nicki Minaj & Other Female Rappers Who Helped Shape Hip Hop</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=egypt-criss---4-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Egypt Criss - $4 Million</span></h2><p>Following the show, everyone probably has an opinion on which career path Criss, daughter of Treach, should focus all her energy on, but on close inspection, she seems to be crushing it all.
