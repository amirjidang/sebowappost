style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>When Hayden Panettiere announced that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she and fiancee Wladimir Klitscho were expecting a baby</a> in 2014, the producers of the hit series Nashville incorporated the actress’s pregnancy into the storyline.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The temperamental character Hayden played, country superstar Juliette Barnes, had clawed her way up from her trailer park past. Viewers were pretty sure they could expect fireworks during the new story arc, and they weren’t wrong.</p><h2 id=scriptwriters-included-ppd-in-the-storyline-of-juliette-barnes>Scriptwriters Included PPD In The Storyline Of Juliette Barnes</h2><p>The outbursts fans had come to expect from Juliette during the first seasons of Nashville grew along with her pregnancy, and viewers followed her tumultuous journey with growing dismay.</p><p>After the on-screen mom gave birth, fans hoping for a turnaround for the antagonistic country star were shocked when Juliette didn’t seem to want to have anything to do with her newborn baby.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Season 3 ended with Barnes throwing a snow globe at husband Avery Barkley, barely missing baby Cadence, who he was holding. And Season 4 began with the country star partying on the road, without much thought for the family she had left behind.</p><p>It was revealed that the character was struggling with Post Partum Depression or PPD.</p><h2 id=the-arc-raised-concerns-at-the-time>The Arc Raised Concerns At The Time</h2><p>The arc was relatively controversial at the time, given that the real-life actress portraying Juliette Barnes was pregnant.</p><p>Like Juliette, Hayden was back at work soon after having her baby. The actress was heralded by fans as being a strong woman for taking that step. However, at the time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hayden said she felt strange filming Season 4.</a></p><p>Although the groundwork for the postpartum storyline had been done months before, there was a shocking real-life twist to come. When Hayden revealed she was seeking treatment for PPD herself, it was a bitter pill for fans to swallow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=barnes-didn-rsquo-t-seek-help-but-hayden-did>Barnes Didn’t Seek Help, But Hayden Did</h2><p>The difference between the actor and her on-screen persona is that while Juliette Barnes refused to seek help, leading to a downward spiral, Hayden did.</p><p>A year after the birth of her daughter, Kaya, the actress took steps to begin treatment for severe postpartum depression.</p><p>Hayden and her character Juliette are among the many new mothers who experience PPD. A clinical diagnosis of depression, it is not a unique experience. Current estimates show that 1 in 7 new mothers will experience PPD in the first year after giving birth.</p><p>There are many <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">celebrities who have been diagnosed with Post Partum Depression</a>, among them Chrissy Tiegen, Cardi B, Drew Barrymore, and Adele.</p><p>Princess Diana also famously struggled with PPD.</p><h2 id=hayden-took-time-off-from-acting>Hayden Took Time Off From Acting</h2><p>When Hayden announced she was taking some time off to heal, it was completely understandable. The actress has been in the limelight since the age of 5, when she won a starring role in the popular daytime soap opera One Life To Live.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since 1994, Panettiere has gone on to star in many other movies and TV shows including the hit series Ally McBeal and Heroes and the movies Racing Stripes, and Ice Princess.</p><p>She was also kept busy as a voice artist, and fans heard her voice as the lovable Dot in the Pixar film A Bug's Life.</p><h2 id=hayden-and-wladimir-split-in-2018>Hayden And Wladimir Split In 2018</h2><p>One of the side effects of PPD include feelings of inadequacy, and not being able to care for your baby, but it's not clear whether Hayden experienced that. However, Hayden has always sung Wladimir's praises as a father.</p><p>When the couple decided to end their relationship in 2018, the ex-boxer was awarded custody of their daughter, a decision supported by Panettiere. He then made the decision to return to Ukraine with Kara.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Often Does Hayden Panettiere See Her Daughter Kaya?</a></span></p><h2 id=there-are-not-many-posts-featuring-kara>There Are Not Many Posts Featuring Kara</h2><p>Like many celebrity parents, Hayden nor Wladimir have taken the decision not to post too many pictures of their daughter.</p><p>One of the actresses' posts in December 2020 showed an image of a special cake to mark her daughter's 6th birthday, rather than an image of her face.</p><p>That's led some fans to believe the actress doesn't have much contact with her daughter. But there are posts that contradict that opinion, showing Hayden and Kaya's special bond.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Hayden has often said she spends daily face time with her child and travels to be with her as much as possible. That's something that might have changed during the Russian offensive against Ukraine.</p><p><a href=#>Hayden has spoken about her Ukrainian daughter following the Russian invasion</a> and revealed that Kara is not currently in the besieged country.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Where Is Hayden Panettiere And Wladimir Klitschko's Daughter During The Ukraine Conflict?</a></span></p><h1></h1><h2 id=fans-are-concerned-about-the-effect-of-hayden-39-s-abusive-relationship>Fans Are Concerned About The Effect Of Hayden's Abusive Relationship</h2><p>In the meantime, Hayden’s life in the US has continued. Fans have been worried about the effect <a href=#>the relationship between Panettiere and Brian Hickerson</a> is having on the Ice Princess star, and concerned that it may affect her journey to recovery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although there are <a href=#>things Panettiere wants to keep out of the spotlight</a>, her relationship with the actor has been fraught with drama. The couple ultimately split after he was jailed and served time at an LA County jail in May last year, stemming from multiple domestic violence and assault allegations during his relationship with the actress.</p><p>However, the couple has been seen together again, spurring anger from fans.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Hayden Panettiere Fans Despair As She Reunites With 'Abusive' Ex Brian Hickerson</a></span></p><p>Those stresses, combined with the concern she must have for the safety of Kara and the child's father, can be dangerous for the star.</p><p>Fans certainly hope that won't be the case, and they look forward to seeing her making a full recovery soon, enabling mother and daughter to spend more time together.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Shawn Mendes Made Some Very Personal Confessions About His Mental Health Battle</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdna66sMSnZKmZnprBtbXEq5xmnJ%2BawK%2FAjKGYr51dmMK0wM6dsGanlmK1pr6MnZiun5ipsrN5z6iqraiRp8G2uYydnKmqlajAqrvNaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bg-compassionate-release-rejected-1234697582.html>&#171;&nbsp;B.G.'s Compassionate Release Rejected A Third Time</a>
