Part of Wolf’s Chicago universe, the crime drama has, so far, run for nine seasons, surviving controversy behind the scenes (<a href=#>one writer got fired for offensive Facebook posts</a>) and shocking cast exits (<a href=#>Sophia Bush left after four seasons</a>). And while the show is set to return for its 10th season, Soffer has confirmed that he won’t be on the show for much longer.In the series, Soffer plays Detective Jay Halstead, an integral member of Chicago PD’s Intelligence Unit. Having been around since the beginning, the character has gone on to become the unit’s de facto second in command. With his impending exit though, it is unclear how the show will write Soffer out (although, he’ll most likely not get killed off, much like <a href=#>how they dealt with Bush’s exit</a>). At the same time, it remains unclear why the actor decided to leave the show in the first place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jesse-lee-soffer-came-to-chicago-pd-after-his-other-nbc-show-was-canceled>Jesse Lee Soffer Came To Chicago PD After His Other NBC Show Was Canceled</h2><p>Soffer, along with Bush, was originally set to star in Charlize Theron’s drama, Hatfields & McCoys, but the show didn’t get picked up.</p><p>Soon after, he made his move to Chicago PD where he and fellow cast members became determined to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">make their portrayal of cops as close to reality as possible</a>. “We’re really trying to make a show that’s honest and stays true to the real lives of Chicago PD,” the actor explained.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How NBC Botched Steve Carell's 'The Office' Exit</a></span></p><p>At the same time, Soffer also expressed his admiration for how his boss, Hank Voight (Jason Beghe), was written in the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I think there is value in ambiguity.

I will always be proud of my time as Det. Jay Halstead.”</p><p>And while some stars may leave shows to pursue other projects, that doesn’t seem to be the case for Soffer. So far, the actor doesn’t have any announced upcoming shows or films. He is also not attached to any other projects in the early stages of development.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-will-happen-to-upstead-after-jesse-lee-soffer-exits>What Will Happen To Upstead After Jesse Lee Soffer Exits?</h2><p>Towards the end of season 9, Jay and longtime girlfriend, Hailey (Tracy Spiridakos), <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tie the knot in a courthouse</a>.</p><p>“I don’t think their characters are the type that need to celebrate it, or the type that really needed to discuss marriage and a wedding. They’re not ceremonial or sentimental in that way,” Soffer said of the characters’ decision to get married.</p><p>“They’re passionate people. And they’re very honest, very real people, so I think after getting over this huge hump with North, the FBI and Roy, they wanted to put it behind them as fast as possible. The next step in their lives is, ‘Well, let’s be together,’ so it was logical.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Most Unconventional Winners From NBC 'The Voice'</a></span></p><p>Soffer’s co-star also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">couldn’t agree more</a>. “It really was the perfect way for that to happen,” Spiridakos said.</p><p>“Things have been so fractured for so long between them that it was a moment for the two of them to reconnect and kind of show that they’re in this together and they’re going to move forward together.”</p><p>With Jay about to be written out of the series, however, fans are already wondering what will happen to Upstead. Surely, the writers will eventually reveal more when season 10 gets underway. For now, however, no one knows what will happen to one of the show’s most beloved couples.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>NBC Hired Hundreds Of Operators In Fear Of A Backlash After The Friends 'Lesbian Wedding' Episode</a></span></p><p>That said, Spiridakos remains ever supportive of her onscreen husband.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Thank you for your kindness, your guidance and your friendship,” the actress wrote on Instagram. “You’re the greatest onscreen husband a girl could ask for.
