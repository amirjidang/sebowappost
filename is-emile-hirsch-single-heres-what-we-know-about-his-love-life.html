Here's what we know about the actor's love life.</p><h2 id=there-have-been-a-lot-of-rumored-flings-and-a-baby-mama>There Have Been&nbsp;A Lot Of Rumored Flings And A Baby Mama</h2><p>Early in both their careers, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hirsch dated Amanda Seyfried from February to June of 2005</a>, after they costarring in the movie Alpha Dog. It was through Hirsch that Seyfried met director Catherine Hardwicke, who later cast her in the film Red Riding Hood. Hirsch knew Hardwicke from working with her in Lords of Dogtown that year.</p><p>"I had known her kind of a little bit before, when I was dating Emile Hirsch, and I had been to her house before," Seyfried told MTV News in 2010. "I completely fell in love with her idea and trusted her from that moment on."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After he and Seyfriend parted ways after their fling ended, Hirsch reportedly dated the Danish model&nbsp;Lucila Valdivia from 2007 to January 2008. There's no report on what he did between January and November of that year, but he started dating Brianna Domont, a producer and visual effects consultant, from November 2008 to 2010. They were seen on the red carpet together multiple times.</p><p>In April of that year, he was rumored to have hooked up with Elliot Page, and Juno Temple, his Killer Joe costar, in November.</p><p>Then we didn't hear much about Hirsch's dating life, but we did know that he'd begun to party heavily. He was apparently Lindsay Lohan's first phone call after she'd finished her 35-day house arrest in 2011. They were seen partying until late that night and into the morning at the Lexington Social House in Hollywood. There's no proof they dated, but Hirsch's partying suggests he might have hooked up with anyone during that time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Happened Between Emile Hirsch And Bono's Daughter?</a></span></p><p>Later on, in 2013, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it was reported that he'd knocked up a random girl he wasn't dating</a>&nbsp;anymore. According to E! News, they "met at an Oscar after-party this year and had a short fling."</p><p>"She is five and a half months pregnant now, but they are not dating," a source told the New York Daily News. "His friends know about it. He is doing the right thing and will be taking care of her and his baby financially."</p><p>"He will definitely be in her life and wants to be a part of the baby's life," the source says. "He's told all his friends about it and it's fine. He plans to be in the kid's life."</p><p>Another source said Hirsch and the woman did have a relationship at one point but were now "trying to figure out what they're going through. They're friends and they're young and they're figuring it out."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine Gun Kelly's Dating History Timeline</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In October of that year, the woman gave birth to Hirsch's son. They named him Valor.</p><p>The next year, he was rumored to have been dating&nbsp;AnnaSophia Robb after she posted a couple of&nbsp;pictures of them together.</p><p>One photo saw them taking a selfie in front of the White House. Robb said they were taking a morning run together before attending the White House Correspondents’ Dinner.</p><h2 id=he-s-started-a-relationship-with-an-instagram-star-15-years-younger-than-him>He's Started A Relationship With An Instagram Star 15 Years Younger Than Him</h2><p>Hirsch's newest relationship started this past year with the Australian Instagram star and model, Elisha Herbert. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The pair were seen together in a park in Los Angeles with Hirsch's son this past summer.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the photos, you can see a haggard-looking Hirsch, his mini-me Valor, who wore Peanuts PJs, and Herbert, who kinda looks like she could be Hirsch's teenaged daughter. And in fact, that wouldn't be too&nbsp;far off. Hirsch is 35&nbsp;and Herbert is 21.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leonardo DiCaprio: The Relationships, The Flings And The Rumored Affairs</a></span></p><p>Apparently, during their outing, Hirsch took the time to release a rat he'd captured back into the wild. Herbert chronicled the entire thing on her Instagram story. Sounds like a nice date.</p><p>"Set a cutie little rat-free this morning," she wrote. "REMINDER not to use deadly rat traps."</p><p>"He got really scared and was running around the cage trying to get out and hurt his nose on the metal. Poor baby."</p><p>So it sounds like she and Hirsch are enjoying catching the rats that live in Hirsch's house. We wonder what they'll do next. Maybe set up a rat sanctuary. Either way, we hope their relationship thrives like the released rat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebrity Couples With Massive Age Gaps</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWVoratsYyhoKurk516tLXNoKOeZZiav6a%2FjLCfmqxdrLJut82ormaZkqTCtXnHoqpmpJ%2Brsm64yJ%2BcaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./is-orvis-going-out-of-business.html>&#171;&nbsp;Is Orvis Going out of Business?</a>
