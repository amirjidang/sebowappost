We’ll feature so many other celebs including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Pitt</a> and George Clooney, their words might surprise you!</p><p>Without further ado, here’s what these celebs have said at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>, both good and bad.

Clooney recalled a pickup basketball game against Leo and his boys, despite the hype around DiCaprio’s game, Clooney wasn’t impressed. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He discussed the experience with E Online;</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“The discrepancy between their game and how they talked about their game made me think of how important it is to have someone in your life to tell you what's what.

Despite the close connection, it was another relationship that just would not last.</p><p>According to a source with People, it is going to take something for special to finally settle the celeb down for good. The source also noted that he just loves getting attention from women in general, hence all the changes in partners over the years.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Leonardo DiCaprio’s Female Costars Have Said About Working With Him</a></span></p><h2 id=jamie-foxx-he-comes-in-so-different><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Jamie Foxx – “He Comes In So Different”</span></h2><p>These two would become close friends – it all started during their time together in Django Unchained. Foxx admittingly didn’t know what to expect prior to meeting Leo, as he had a different perception thanks to the tabloids. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">As he stated with Vanity Fair,</a> the real Leo was much different;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Here comes Leonardo DiCaprio, the good-looking guy that you see in the tabloids with the models.

Although most of her thoughts are positive – she did admit that for certain things, she turned a blind eye. Once the realization hit, Leo wasn’t willing to take the same honest look at himself;</p><p>“I was becoming more and more aware of things that I’d chosen not to look at. Was I alone in wanting to do some serious soul-searching while he stayed the same? In the end, unfortunately, the answer was yes.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Most Celebs Praise Leonardo DiCaprio, But Some Think He’s Overrated</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michael-jordan-all-for-one-and-one-for-all><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Michael Jordan – “All For One And One For All”</span></h2><p>Leo was already sniffing in Hollywood icon territory during the ‘90s. He was making several close connections – one with the face of sports in the ‘90s, Michael Jordan.</p><p>As we recently saw in The Last Dance, Leo was present for the festivities out in the locker room. MJ would even reference Leo’s line from The Man in the Iron Mask – Jordan uttered the line to his teammates, "all for one and one for all.”</p><h2 id=jonah-hill-he-gave-me-the-best-advice><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jonah Hill – “He Gave Me The Best Advice”</span></h2><p>It was a career-changing moment for Jonah Hill as he took part in the Wolf On Wallstreet.

Pitt made mention that he put a restraining order on DiCaprio back in the ‘90s. That might’ve had something to do with his relationship alongside Gwyneth Paltrow, as the two broke off the engagement in ’97 and she was seen with Leo shortly after;</p><p>“Yeah, I had a restraining order against [DiCaprio] for a while… over an incident in 1994 that we don’t like to talk about.”</p><h2 id=margot-robbie-he-s-a-down-to-earth-person><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Margot Robbie – “He’s A Down To Earth Person”</span></h2><p>Robbie worked alongside Leo during The Wolf On Wall Street – she also had the nerve-racking moment of having to completely disrobe in front of the actor. Despite the moment, she was thankful to have worked alongside Leo – she was also surprised by how humble he is;</p><p>“He’s an incredible actor, everyone knows that, but he’s also a really awesome down to earth person so it was a really lovely experience.

I guess love does that.”</p><p>As it turns out, Leo leaves a good impression with his exes as well, that at least the case with Erin Heatherton, who remains on good terms with Leo despite the separation, according to her words with AZ Central.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kate-winslet-it-is-like-family><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Kate Winslet – “It Is Like Family”</span></h2><p>Although the media and fans would love these two to share a real-life romance, as they depicted in Titan, Winslet admitted with Elle that their bond is more so family-like, as they remain closer than ever;</p><p>“I do feel so grateful for that friendship, and honestly it is like family and one of those rare Hollywood friendships that I feel very, very blessed to have."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT –<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leonardo DiCaprio: The Relationships, The Flings And The Rumored Affairs</a></span></p><p>Sources – People, Vanity Fair, E Online & College Times</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsGpsdKeZJydnJqvtHnHmq2eZaOWtqV5wJumrqxdobKwusCrm6hllJ6worzRoqZmn5%2BksW6tzZ1km5mUZA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./whats-wrong-with-andy-richters-wife-sarah-thyre-hair-264392-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Whats Wrong With Andy Richters Wife Sarah Thyre Hair?</a>
