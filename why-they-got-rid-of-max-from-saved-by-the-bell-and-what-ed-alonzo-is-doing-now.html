For several years, he spoke about his desire for another version of the popular show. While no one knows how long he would have actually stayed on the series, it seems like he might have wanted to stay for longer than just one season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/why-they-got-rid-of-max-from-saved-by-the-bell-and-what-ed-alonzo-is-really-doing-now.jpg><p>According to CBC.ca, there was a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pop-up version of The Max in Chicago</a>, and he was there, too. It was fun for fans to get the chance to meet Alonzo, and he also talked about a reboot. He told CBC, "Unfortunately, I don't think there'll ever be like a Saved by the Bell television special reunion. I think this is as close as I'll get to it. This is better than the original Max that we used to shoot the show on over at NBC."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Stars Appeared On Saved By The Bell Before They Were Famous</a></span></p><p>In 2018, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alonzo talked about a potential reboot</a> and had a plotline in mind. He told Entertainment Tonight, "There should be a show based on The Max to where maybe the kids that were on Saved by the Bell, their kids are now hanging out at The Max."</p><p>Of course, Alonzo got his wish. The Saved By The Bell reboot aired from 2020 to 2022 on Peacock.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ed-alonzo.jpg><p>The actor's proposed storyline is actually pretty close to the reboot's.

His IMDb page includes surprisingly few roles. He played himself in an episode of Full House that aired in 1998. In 2012, he played Guard #2 in one episode of How I Met Your Mother. Two years later, he played Kaiser Mayhem in one episode of Modern Family.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Famous Stars Were Originally Cast In Saved By The Bell Before Losing Their Jobs</a></span></p><p>After leaving Saved By The Bell, Ed Alonzo leaned into his love of magic. He has been working as a magician for a long time. According to his website, he is a "comedy magician. He makes sure that his shows are as hilarious and entertaining as they are awe-inspiring and magical.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ed-alonzo-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alonzo's website bio says that he performed at the Magic Castle, which is located in Hollywood, when he was only in high school. He realized that he loved magic when he was seven and has been exploring it ever since. He has been performing on the TV show Masters of Illusion, which airs on The CW, for a long time. The show has had 12 seasons and is still going very strong.</p><p>According to Photosfromthepit.com, Alzono also gives people advice about magic. He was hired by Michael Jackson, Katy Perry, and Britney Spears to help with some of their performances.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ed-alonzo-masters-of-illusion.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is definitely a case of art imitating life. As Saved By The Bell fans know, Max loves magic and often entertains the main characters on Saved By The Bell when they sit at a table ordering burgers and fries.</p><p>If his recent work is any indication, Alonzo seems to prefer magic to acting. While he played a character named Gerry on the HBO drama Minx in 2022, he only appeared in one episode. If Saved By The Bell fans want to see him these days, it definitely seems like catching one of his magic shows is the best way to go. He talks about this part of his life on his Instagram all the time.</p><p>In 2017, the actor was interviewed by KCAL9 and explained his enthusiasm for magic. He said, "I love the reactions of the people."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ed-alonzo-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alonzo is still a big part of Hollywood, though, and he has been picketing during the Summer 2023 WGA strike. He shared several photos of himself on the picket line on his Instagram. He also dressed up as Max from Saved By The Bell and handed burgers to people.
