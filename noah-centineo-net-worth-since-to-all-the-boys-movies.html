And of all the boys that Lara Jean takes an interest in, it’s Centineo’s Peter that stick around till the end of the story.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'To All The Boys' Writer Hints At Lara Jean And Daphne Bridgerton Connection</a></span></p><p>Ever since Centineo landed the role, he’s also gotten cast in other major projects. Not only that, the actor has also become quite the filmmaker himself, taking on some producing work recently.</p><p>With all these going on, one can’t help but wonder how much cash Centineo has amassed by now.

As it turns out, the team behind the movie had another actor in mind for the role but that didn’t work out in the end.</p><p>“Ben Hardy was originally attached to play the part,” the film’s screenwriter, Lindsey Beer, told ET. “His schedule ended up not working out, so we had to audition other people.”</p><p>It’s a good thing that casting director Tamara-Lee Notcutt had Centineo come in for a supporting role, so he essentially showed up the moment they needed him to.</p><p>“With Jamey, we were looking for somebody who could play a more soulful type and somebody with the puppy dog eyes who the girls would like, but who kind of had a unique sincerity to him and Noah absolutely did,” Beer explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I didn’t have a specific actor in mind when I wrote this and I wrote it a long time ago, over six years ago, but I did have a generic image in mind of Jamey and Noah just looked and embodied him to a T, it almost weirded me out.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Heartthrob Noah Centineo's Best Roles</a></span></p><p>Soon after, Centineo also landed the lead role in the Netflix romantic comedy The Perfect Date. It was a film that got the actor interested from the beginning <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">since it isn’t the typical rom-com</a>.</p><p>“Underneath the surface, there's really a lot more to it. There's self-discovery and self-acceptance,” the actor told Pop Sugar. “And I think this is a very lighthearted way to introduce these principles to the younger audience…”</p><p>Around the same time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actor also starred in a reboot of Charlie’s Angels</a> where he plays a love interest. “It's a little bit different, which is cool,” Centineo told -iD of his role in the film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“There’s an action part to it as well.

I really do thoroughly enjoy it.”</p><p>At the same time, Centineo also recently reprised his role as Jesus Adam Foster in The Fosters’ spinoff Good Trouble. For the actor, being able to play Jesus again was incredible.</p><p>“You got to watch it, because it's dope! Not just my character in it, which is really funny, like how they bring him back. But I saw the second episode.... and the show is shot like differently than The Fosters,” the actor told ET.</p><p>“I love the way they're tying in different angles and editing it together. The content on the show, what they're writing about, is different.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition, the series also came to him at just the right time. “As a 22-year-old, I relate to the show a lot, and it was really, really, really cool to see it," Centineo explained.
