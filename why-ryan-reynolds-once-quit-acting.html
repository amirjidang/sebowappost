Reynolds clearly loves what he does, but it turns out there was a time when he was on the verge of giving up acting entirely.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Ryan Reynolds Is Playing The Same Character In Every Movie And It’s Getting Downright Aggravating</a></span></p><p>Reynolds may currently be an A-list actor, but his career actually got its start while he was still very young. In fact, when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he appeared for a segment on Live with Kelly and Michael</a>, the hosts at the time, Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan, surprised him with a clip from his very first acting role in 1991, when he featured as Billy Simpson on the Nickelodeon series Fifteen.</p><p>Although it was obvious that Reynolds enjoyed revisiting his early performances as a kid actor, he also made an unexpected admission. “I quit acting after that. I hated it then. I really did.” Additionally, he said that he only accepted his first acting role "to get out of the house."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reynolds continued by saying that he is "glad" he decided to take jobs at a restaurant and warehouse for a period of time after giving up his life as a young actor. He said, "I had some real life experiences."</p><p>He was also dealing with something else at the time, which may have had an impact on his choice to take a break from acting for a while as well as possibly inspiring him to return to his on-screen profession.</p><h2 id=ryan-reynolds-took-hiatus-from-acting-due-to-disappointing-movies>Ryan Reynolds Took Hiatus From Acting Due To Disappointing Movies</h2><p>Not only Reynolds decided to take a break from acting during his early career because he hated it, but the actor also took a long hiatus from the industry <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">because of a series of disappointing movies</a>. That was the point where he became disillusioned by the film industry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/th-image-template-5-7.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It wasn’t like I was having a very illustrious career up in Canada. I was doing all of these movie-of-the-weeks with all of these ex-Dynasty stars. It was depressing. I would have rather gone to university or become a teacher, so I did quit, I stopped acting for about a year,” Reynolds admitted.</p><p>Fortunately, his career improved after he moved to Los Angeles with a friend on a whim. “I was there for a short time and got an agent who sent me on an audition for a show called Two Guys and a Girl and I got that,” he said.</p><p>After he relocated to LA, Reynolds' career saw a steady ascent. He rose to fame primarily as a result of <a href=#>his roles in comedic films</a> like The In-Laws, Just Friends, The Proposal, and a lot more. He eventually transitioned to playing more serious roles in movies. He has been known for his roles in a plethora of genres of movies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Ryan Reynolds Has Crushed It In Films Of Almost Every Genre</a></span></p><p>Also, following the success of Deadpool, <a href=#>Reynolds continued to enjoy a flourishing career</a>.
