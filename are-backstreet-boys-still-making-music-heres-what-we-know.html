Consisted of the likes of <a href=#>Nick Carter</a>, Howie Dorough, Brian Littrell, AJ McLean, and Kevin Richardson, the Orlando-based band rose to international stardom thanks to their 1999 album Millennium. The album was an important cornerstone of pop culture at the time, selling 24 million copies worldwide and scoring history as one of the best-selling albums of all time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Britney Spears Says This Is Her Greatest Career Regret</a></span></p><p>That being said, the glory days of Backstreet Boys are long gone, and we're wondering what's happening to the band's members now. However, their last full-length material, DNA, was released in 2019 and it <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">debuted atop the Billboard 200</a> chart after nearly 20 years, proving that the band's longevity shouldn't be put into question. To sum it up, here's everything the band members have been up to.</p><h2 id=nick-carter-ventured-as-a-solo-artist-amp-a-reality-series-star><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Nick Carter Ventured As A Solo Artist & A Reality Series Star</span></h2><p>Despite still being with the band, Nick Carter also landed a lucrative signing contract as a solo artist under Jive Records. His debut as a soloist, Now or Never, did remarkably well on the chart, proving that he's a standout member of the band. However, it's been a while since his last album, All American, hit the stores in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Carter's endless ventures in TV landed him at least two dedicated reality shows, House of Carters (2006) and VH1's I Heart Nick Carter (2014). He was on Dancing with the Stars once in 2015 and came in third place on Season 4 of The Masked Singer in 2020. In terms of personal life, Carter has just welcomed his third baby earlier this year from his relationship with Lauren Kitt, and it's safe to say that it's been quite an eventful few years for the singer.</p><h2 id=howie-dorough-founded-a-company-amp-starred-in-a-musical><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Howie Dorough Founded A Company & Starred In A Musical</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to his impressive singing portfolio, Howie Dorough has also been busy expanding his business empire. Back in 2012, the singer launched a company called Sweet D, Inc. with his older brother John, specializing in real estate development and consultation. He also managed Canadian-based rock band Neverest who served as an opening act for BSB's NKOTBSB Tour back in 2011 before its disbandment in 2015.</p><p>Last year, Dorough also developed a musical loosely based on his real-life story. Titled Howie D: Back in the Day, the play took place at The Rose Theater in Omaha, Nebraska.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything We Know About The Backstreet Boys' Wives & Kids</a></span></p><h2 id=brian-littrell-made-a-cameo-appearance-in-39-dynasty-39-amp-ventured-into-christian-music><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Brian Littrell Made A Cameo Appearance In 'Dynasty' & Ventured Into Christian Music</span></h2><p>Besides his musical adventure with the Boys, Brian Littrell has always longed for Christian music. In fact, his 2005 debut album as a soloist under Reunion and Sony BMG, Welcome Home, was a massive success, charting atop the Billboard's Hot Christian Songs list of the year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Additionally, he also has several TV cameos as himself over the years. The latest cameo appearance he had was on Season 4 of Richard and Esther Shapiro's soap opera Dynasty last year.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Things Most Fans Don’t Know About NSYNC</a></span></p><h2 id=aj-mclean-declared-his-sobriety><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>AJ McLean Declared His Sobriety</span></h2><p>Unfortunately, fame can sometimes take its toll. AJ McLean had suffered from alcoholism amidst the commercial peak of the band in the early 2000s and it's been a long-lasting battle for him. After several unsuccessful stints, AJ checked himself into rehab for the third time in 2011 and he's been sober since then.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I’m on a very strict diet, grain-free, gluten-free, sugar-free, no sodas of any kind, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">completely sober for almost nine months,” </a>the actor said in 2020 as reported by Us Weekly. "This amazing, but rigorous, workout is all due to my amazing trainer, Mr. Bobby Strong. He’s been a huge asset in my transformation, trying to get myself prepared and ready for what’s to come in the next few weeks."</p><h2 id=kevin-richardson-has-yet-to-release-his-debut-solo-album><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Kevin Richardson Has Yet To Release His Debut Solo Album</span></h2><p>In 2006, Kevin Richardson left Backstreet Boys to focus on other business ventures. However, his exit from the band didn't last long, as he rejoined BSB permanently six years later. Since then, unlike his other bandmates, the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame recipient has been struggling to put out his debut album as a solo artist. He stated in the early 2010s that he's been working on an album called Cover Story, in which the singer performs his rendition of several popular songs. He planned to release the album in 2015, but as of 2021, Cover Story hasn't seen the light of the day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-39-s-next-for-backstreet-boys><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What's Next For Backstreet Boys?</span></h2><p>It's safe to say that Backstreet Boys are destined to revive their career once again. As mentioned, their latest album, DNA, was a massive success in 2019, and fans are more than ready for whatever the Boys have in store. Last year, the band has been working tightly on a forthcoming Christmas-flavored project amidst the pandemic and was gearing up for a holiday residency concert although they canceled the latter due to the ongoing health crisis.</p><p>"We have decided to wait until 2022 to release our Christmas album and subsequently will be canceling our limited Las Vegas run of Christmas shows," the band's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> reads. "We absolutely cannot wait to share the magic of this album with all of you when the time is right!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Happened To D12?
