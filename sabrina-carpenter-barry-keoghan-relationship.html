After all, she is a <strong><a href=#>music</a></strong> superstar who is friends with Taylor Swift, and he is an Oscar-nominated superstar actor.</p><p>In reality, however, Keoghan and Carpenter have both struggled.

For that reason, fans were overjoyed when Carpenter shared details about her happy relationship with Keoghan.</p><p>This article will reveal <strong>what Sabrina Carpenter said about her relationship with Barry Keoghan</strong> in January 2024.

However, in the weeks and months that followed, the duo wouldn't confirm those suspicions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Looking back on how Keoghan and Carpenter handled things during that time period is fascinating. After all, the two stars never seemed to really be trying to hide they were a couple, but they also didn't do anything to confirm they were together.</p><p>A perfect example of how Carpenter and Keoghan handled things at that time was an interview she gave Cosmopolitan in January 2024. While talking to the outlet, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Carpenter spoke about what her dating life was like</a></strong> at that time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sabrina-carpenter-had-intense-mental-health-issues-after-becoming-a-disney-child-star-deposit.jpg><p>When Cosmopolitan published their article which stemmed from their interview with Carpenter, they included a timeline clarification. As the outlet explained, they interviewed Carpenter in January 2024. Cosmo's article reveals that at the time, rumors about Carpenter and Keoghan were still "fuzzy".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>How much older is Barry Keoghan than Sabrina Carpenter, according to Famous People?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>When was Barry Keoghan born?:</p></td><td><p>October 18, 1992</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>When was Sabrina Carpenter born?:</p></td><td><p>May 11, 1999</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>How much older is Barry Keoghan than Sabrina Carpenter?:</p></td><td><p>6 years, 6 months, and 23 days</p></td></tr></tbody></table><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/barry-keoghan-as-druig-in-marvel-studio-s-eternals-via-youtube-cilyra-channel-channel.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Barry Keoghan Just Got Real About What Went Wrong With Eternals">Barry Keoghan Just Got Real About What Went Wrong With Eternals</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>It's fair to say that Eternals didn't meet expectations, and Barry Keoghan has thoughts on why it flopped.</p><p>Despite that, when Cosmopolitan asked Carpenter about her dating life, <strong>she spoke about enjoying something new in her love life</strong>. Carpenter also described her love life at the time in an interesting way.</p><p>"So yeah, it’s fun and it’s messy.

However, the fact that it now seems clear that she was dating Keoghan at the time colors all of her comments.</p><p>In the past, other celebrities have spoken about avoiding talking specifically about their relationships in public. One example of that is Zendaya, who told The Hollywood Reporter why she and Tom Holland are careful about what they reveal about their relationship. "Our relationship is something that we are incredibly protective of and we want to keep it as sacred as possible. We don't think that we owe it to anyone, it's our thing, and it has nothing to do with our careers."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/untitled-design-26.jpg><p>A perfect example of that is what Carpenter said about <strong>the type of person she was interested in</strong>. Since Carpenter was very likely involved with Keoghan then, it seems safe to assume she was describing the kind of person she thought he was.</p><p>"I want to be with someone who’s going to be one of my best friends. So a lot of it is energy and humor and being genuine. I will say I’ve always connected more with people who are really in touch with their emotions."</p><h2 id=sabrina-carpenter-and-barry-keoghan-sort-of-made-their-red-carpet-debut-as-a-couple-at-the-2024-met-gala>Sabrina Carpenter And Barry Keoghan Sort Of Made Their Red Carpet Debut As A Couple At The 2024 Met Gala</h2><p>As anyone who follows the fashion world already knows, The Met Gala is a big deal. Despite that, it could be argued that <a href=#>The 2024 Met Gala</a> was more newsworthy than most. After all, a lot of news was broken at The 2024 Met Gala, including the fact that <strong>Sabrina Carpenter and Barry Keoghan kind of made their red carpet debut</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ttweb_sabrina-carpenter-s-slow-rise-might-have-something-to-do-with-being-sued-by-her-former-managers_bk_a1_v4.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Sabrina Carpenter's Slow Rise Might Have Something To Do With Being Sued By Her Former Managers">Sabrina Carpenter's Slow Rise Might Have Something To Do With Being Sued By Her Former Managers</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Sabrina Carpenter faced a major lawsuit at what could have been a turning point in her career. Carpenter's career was stalled instead.</p><p>When Carpenter and Keoghan made their way up along the red carpet at the event, they mostly walked alone. However, before the night ended, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Keoghan and Carpenter posed for photos together</a></strong> for the first time at a red carpet event.</p><p>In the photos, <strong>Keoghan can be seen with his arm around Carpenter's waist</strong> as the duo stand very close together.</p><p>It is important to note, that these photos look very professional and that the two stars clearly posed for them. With those two factors in mind, it is abundantly clear that Keoghan and Carpenter meant to look like a couple. After all, there is no way they don't know about <strong>the conjecture about their relationship</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sabrina-carpenter-barry-keoghan-96th-academy-awards-vanity-fair-party.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amazingly enough, however, the photos of Keoghan and Carpenter together weren't the most newsworthy part of the duo attending The 2024 Met Gala. Instead, footage that Vogue took of Carpenter and Keoghan was far more remarkable.</p><p>As other celebrities have before her, Carpenter allowed Vogue to film the process of her getting ready for The 2024 Met Gala. Partway through the resulting video that Vogue released, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Keoghan enters the hotel room where Carpenter was</a></strong> getting ready.</p><p>Since Vogue's cameras were there, they captured <strong>Carpenter and Keoghan embracing in a hug</strong>. The cameras also got footage of <strong>Keoghan planting a kiss on Carpenter's cheek</strong>. While that obviously is tame, it was <strong>the couple's first example of PDA</strong>. On top of that, Keoghan clearly wouldn't have wanted to kiss Carpenter on the lips and mess up her makeup too much.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqmpqinruiecKaqamdnqmys3nBmqmrsV2gsrCzx5qlZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGQ%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./sam-riegel-bio-wiki-age-height-wife-emmy-shirt-movies-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Sam Riegel Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Wife, Emmy, Shirt, Movies, Net Worth</a>
