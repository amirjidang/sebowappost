Rumors have it that she is already engaged to him.</p><p>Fans were curious to find out if Angelina Pivarnick had moved on after her marriage with <span>Chris Larangeira</span> and if she had got herself a new boyfriend because it’s 2023 and it’s been two years since her divorce. Now that the reality star walked the red carpet at the <span>Real Housewives of New Jersey</span> premiere with Vinny Tortorella in matching black outfits and <span>made their debut as a couple</span>, people now know that she’s moved on and has been dating him. She also took her new beau as her plus-one at her sister <span>Alyssa Pivarnick</span>‘s wedding.</p><p>Well, it’s time she moved on. It’s been a long time since Angelina Pivarnick’s divorce from Chris Larangeira was finalized. The end of her marriage must have been hard for her, what with having to deal with all the accusations of infidelity and infidelity itself. Her ex-husband suspected that she had a series of affairs with her <span>All Star Shore</span> costar <span>Luis ‘Porto’ Caballero</span> and then with another man named <span>Joe</span>, and immediately moved out of their home. And that was the end of the marriage. Pivarnick has denied cheating but it was of no use. Their <span>divorce</span> was a long process.</p><p>However, all that’s behind her now.

When <span>Jenni Farley</span> pushed for more details about the relationship, Angelina told that she did not see a future with anyone but she was just gonna enjoy herself.</p><p>In Season six which premiered January 26, Vinny Tortorella came up again during a game of Truth or Dare when Angelina Pivarnick shared that her new boyfriend was prying into her love life and she found that flattering and cute. The trailer of<span> Jersey Shore: Family Vacation</span><span>teased that he would be making his debut</span> later next season. Viewers were excited that they would finally get to meet him.</p><p>They were looking forward to knowing Vinny Tortorella ever since the rumors that he and Angelina Pavernick were engaged, surfaced. The rumors that she had taken the next step in her relationship with her new boyfriend and gotten engaged to him started after a TikTok video of a proposal went viral. In the video that was taken during the filming of the reality show in New Orleans, the Jersey Shore cast was seated for a meal. And a man believed to be Vinny ‘the mystery man’ at the time dropped down to one knee and lifted a small box in Pavernick’s direction.</p><p>The rumors that Angelina Pivarnick and her boyfriend Vinny Tortorella got engaged were debunked quickly when it was reported that the video “was a prank” despite it looking like a real proposal.
