You know, the one that's always on the tip of your tongue? Hollywood is an ever-shifting place, and people come and go quickly. Whether it's someone <a href=#>from a hit TV show</a>, <a href=#>from a movie you love</a>, or <a href=#>from tabloid fodder</a>, we tend to lose track of some people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Robin Tunney was brilliant on The Mentalist, and she has been keeping busy since starring on the hit show. In fact, she has been holding it down on set and the homestead since the shown ended back in 2016.</p><p>Let's shine a light on Robin Tunney and see what she's been up to since her hit series came to an end.</p><h2 id=robin-tunney-was-great-on-39-the-mentalist-39>Robin Tunney Was Great On 'The Mentalist'</h2><p>From 2008 to 2015, actress Robin Tunney played the character Teresa Lisbon on the hit series The Mentalist. The actress had found plenty of success prior to landing on the show, but this series really took things to another level after it became a smashing success.</p><p>As the series was nearing its end, Tunney expressed happiness with the fact that the series and its characters were getting a proper ending.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I kind of feel like I’ve gotten [my wish], that we’ve actually gotten a definitive last season, and they can tie everything up. It’s really unusual, and I know we’re putting it to bed in a proper way. Because it has been a really long run. And the fans are really attached to these characters. I feel lucky about that. I’m just really happy that we get to have a real ending. You get to satiate the characters and yourself that there is a solid ending to the story," she said.</p><p>It has been a number of years since the actress was a featured performer on the show, and thankfully, she has remained busy both on the big and small screen.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Whatever Happened To Leo From 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen'?</a></span></p><h2 id=tunney-has-been-on-shows-like-39-the-fix-39>Tunney Has Been On Shows Like 'The Fix'</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given the success that she was able to find out The Mentalist, it makes sense that fans would expect robin Tunney to continue starring in projects on the small screen.</p><p>Since the ending of The Mentalist in 2015, Tony has taken part in several different projects. She has been featured on Love and on Insatiable, and in 2019, she landed a starring role on the series The Fix.</p><p>When discussing the series with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Chicago Tribune</a>, Tunney said, "Introducing something new into the world is stressful. You really want everybody to like it, but I think people are enjoying it. It’s created by women. Marcia Clark obviously created it. I think she and Liz (Craft) and Sarah (Fain) wrote a different kind of woman than a man would have. The character’s in her 40s, but she’s still vital."</p><p>after just a single season on the air, The Fix was canceled by ABC.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The Fix is no longer in at ABC: The network has cancelled the Marcia Clark-produced legal thriller after one season, TVLine has learned.The series’ March debut drew 4.4 million viewers and a 0.7 demo rating, with TVLine readers giving the premiere an average “B” grade," TV Line reported.</p><p>Things didn't pan out on that show, but thankfully, Robin Tunney has been involved in a number of projects on the big screen, as well.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Whatever Happened To Belinda From 'A Walk To Remember'?</a></span></p><h2 id=robin-tunney-has-also-worked-on-the-big-screen>Robin Tunney Has Also Worked On The Big-Screen</h2><p>After primarily shifting her focus to television while starting on The Mentalist, fans were excited to see Robin Tunney make her way back to the big screen to take part in a number of different projects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She has been featured in movies like Looking Glass, Monster Party, and Horse Girl, which was a Netflix release starring Alison Brie.</p><p>As it stands right now, the actress does not have any film or television projects lined up. This does not mean that she won't return to acting at some point, but rather that she just does not have anything on tap at the moment.</p><p>The actress, however, is focusing her time on raising her two children.</p><p>In 2020, she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">gave birth to her second child</a>, and she took to social media for the announcement.</p><p>"We are thrilled to introduce you to Colette Kathleen. Oscar is now a big brother. I gave birth January 8th and our hearts have gotten bigger whilst our rest has shrunken considerably. This firecracker came out with a thick head of strawberry blonde hair, ready to take over the world. #newborn #babygirl," she wrote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Whatever Happened To The Maximoff Twins From 'WandaVision'?</a></span></p><p>Robin Tunney has had a wonderful career in the entertainment industry, and fans cannot wait to see what she does next.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Whatever Happened To Jenni Rivera's Last Husband, Esteban Loaiza?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brnEp6uapJmowW6%2F05qpZqqfl7avedOupaedqWQ%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./where-does-wendy-williams-relationship-with-her-exhusband-kevin-hunter-stand-today.html>&#171;&nbsp;Where Does Wendy Williams Relationship With Her Ex-Husband Kevin Hunter Stand Today?</a>
