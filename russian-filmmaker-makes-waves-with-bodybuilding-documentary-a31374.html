But the&nbsp;film outperformed all expectations … It's exciting. I think people underestimated the&nbsp;following that bodybuilding has," says the&nbsp;film's director, Vlad Yudin, speaking over the&nbsp;phone from&nbsp;his New York office.</p><p>Perhaps one of&nbsp;the reasons it has been so successful is that little is known about the&nbsp;world of&nbsp;professional bodybuilding, because professional bodybuilding is a&nbsp;topic that has been explored so little by&nbsp;the mass media in&nbsp;general, especially about what happens behind the&nbsp;scenes.</p><p>The&nbsp;subject of&nbsp;Generation Iron, his fourth feature, is worlds apart from&nbsp;Yudin's earlier films. His first two features were music-related documentaries, followed by&nbsp;the comedy-drama "The Last Day of&nbsp;Summer," which made it to&nbsp;Russia on&nbsp;DVD.</p><p>Born in&nbsp;and raised in&nbsp;Russia, Yudin moved to&nbsp;New York in&nbsp;the mid-90s when he was 12 years old as his family wanted him to&nbsp;be educated in&nbsp;the U.S. After high school, he studied business but after receiving his degree, decided to&nbsp;pursue filmmaking at&nbsp;NYU.</p><p>Eschewing traditional Hollywood studio models, he brought his business and&nbsp;filmmaking acumen together in&nbsp;The Vladar Company, a&nbsp;film production company he founded in&nbsp;2008 through which he makes and&nbsp;distributes his films.</p><p>He explains that what drew him to&nbsp;the secluded world of&nbsp;professional bodybuilding was precisely the&nbsp;fact that he knew so little about it. The&nbsp;only reference he had was "Pumping Iron," a&nbsp;docudrama released more than 35 years ago that popularized the&nbsp;sport and&nbsp;brought Arnold Schwarzenegger international fame, so he teamed up with Jerome Gary, its producer.</p><p>Yudin wanted to&nbsp;find out what has happened in&nbsp;the sport since then, and&nbsp;how it has advanced since the&nbsp;1970s. When Schwarzenegger dominated the&nbsp;sport, Mr. Olympia was largely an&nbsp;amateur competition with a&nbsp;$1,000 cash prize. Now, winners take home $250,000 and&nbsp;competitors are dedicated professionals. However, the&nbsp;sport is still a&nbsp;very insular one, unknown to&nbsp;mainstream culture.</p><p>"For most people, they stereotype bodybuilders as being guys with no brains at&nbsp;all. Unfortunately in&nbsp;the media, we can see that a&nbsp;lot, people make fun of&nbsp;bodybuilders as opposed to&nbsp;embracing them, even though all the&nbsp;fitness, all the&nbsp;supplements you see in&nbsp;stores, all the&nbsp;gyms, basically across the&nbsp;world, they come from&nbsp;from bodybuilding. That's the&nbsp;core of&nbsp;it all, that's where it all starts, but it's not being appreciated in&nbsp;the open," Yudin laments.</p><p>Pumping Iron focused on&nbsp;the gym and&nbsp;the stage, but Yudin received unprecedented direct access to&nbsp;the athletes. "Usually bodybuilders are very private people, they're kind of&nbsp;intimidating. I think for&nbsp;many years, people tried to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;film that tried to&nbsp;expose something. It's a&nbsp;very misunderstood sport," Yudin tells me. But he gained their support after they saw what he was trying to&nbsp;do. He spent a&nbsp;few months with them, traveling from&nbsp;city to&nbsp;city, spending time with their families, spending time in&nbsp;their homes.</p><p>While the&nbsp;film is about bodybuilding, it focuses more on&nbsp;the athletes, particularly on&nbsp;the rivalry and&nbsp;relationship between the&nbsp;sport's two biggest names, Phil Heath, the&nbsp;current champion, and&nbsp;his rival Kai Greene. The&nbsp;result is an&nbsp;intimate portrait of&nbsp;the personal battles and&nbsp;existential crises of&nbsp;athletes, of&nbsp;determination and&nbsp;competition that extends beyond bodybuilding.</p><p>"There's a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;elements that go into&nbsp;the sport, and&nbsp;really wanted to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;its mental aspect, on&nbsp;how these guys get ready and&nbsp;what their life stories are. And&nbsp;I discovered a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;interesting stories."</p><p>Yudin said he was most surprised by&nbsp;the sensitivity of&nbsp;the bodybuilders, saying that "a professional bodybuilder is very similar to&nbsp;a painter or a&nbsp;sculptor, as opposed to&nbsp;an athlete, even though they're large guys with muscles. For&nbsp;them to&nbsp;get on&nbsp;the stage and&nbsp;to create what is essentially an&nbsp;art piece, it takes a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;thought and&nbsp;preparation."</p><p>Russian audiences will get to&nbsp;catch Generation Iron on&nbsp;the big screen soon. The&nbsp;film is being released in&nbsp;several markets in&nbsp;Europe, after which he hopes to&nbsp;bring it to&nbsp;Russia, which he is aiming to&nbsp;do for&nbsp;spring.</p><p>Contact the&nbsp;author at&nbsp;<a href=#>t.misir@imedia.ru</a><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEpqasm5%2Bswaq5xKxlnKedZH9xfZNoZ2pnYmh8s8HSrKCapl2btq25zJqinqpdoq6ssdJmrpqulah6uLXToWSbp5Sur7a1y52gp59dmbykwcyepa2Zoq56on%2BQbG5t</p></div><div id=links><a href=./sean-penn-dyes-his-hair-blonde-like-girlfriend-charlize-therons-pic-2014412.html>&#171;&nbsp;Sean Penn Dyes His Hair Blonde Like Girlfriend Charlize Theron's: Pic</a>
