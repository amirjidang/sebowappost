Though, some events leave us scratching our heads. Comedian Adam DeVine had a <a href=#>pretty normal childhood up until the day he was hit by a cement truck</a>. The incident had shattered an 11-year-old DeVine’s dreams of playing professional baseball, but in the end, there was a silver lining. The 36-year-old explained to Entertainment Weekly that he was walking to a local store with a friend that day to buy candy but instead, had plans to tear out the pages of an adult magazine at the time called PENTHOUSE.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A simple error in communication that quickly turned fatal took place between DeVine and his friend who had already crossed the street to the local store. The 36-year-old told Entertainment Weekly that he thought his friend had told him the coast is clear and “to come look at boobies.” The Modern Family star made the mistake of walking the street after three cement trucks had already passed. Sources reported that there was a fourth truck DeVine hadn’t seen coming until it was too late.</p><p>DeVine recalled the horrific incident in graphic detail, describing it as, “The truck picked me up under the first two wheels and then spit me out. I still slid 500 feet.” The comedian was one lucky kid as he clearly survived the incident. The doctors explained that if it hadn’t been for his bike “taking the first hit” he wouldn’t be alive today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the fact that DeVine survived, he still sustained major injuries that resulted in 25 surgeries, going into a Coma, and almost getting his legs amputated. In the end, DeVine was confined to a wheelchair for some time. For 2 years, the actor taught himself how to walk again, rebuilding the strength back in his legs. The event was challenging for the Modern Family star, but it was the just the confidence boost he needed to face life’s challenges.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Devine Tells Jimmy Fallon About His Broken Rib From A Demolition Derby In 'Bad Ideas'</a></span></p><h2 id=fight-back-with-words>Fight Back With Words</h2><p>Getting hit by a cement truck can traumatize anyone, especially a child. Adam DeVine wasn’t going to let the accident get the best of him though. The 36-year-old went through several surgeries from 6th grade to his Freshman year of high school. Clearly, he had a rough time in school. The comedian explained to actor Dax Shepard on his Armchair Expert podcast <a href=#>that the aftermath of the accident made him a constant target for bullies</a>. Luckily, his dad’s advice helped DeVine survive through school.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>DeVine’s dad told him that since he was confined to a wheelchair and couldn’t risk getting into a physical altercation, he suggested that he’d write down his rebuttals. “I would go home and write in notebooks possible mean things that people could say to me and retorts. So I had notebooks and notebooks full of slams on these kids and I would just annihilate them and no one can beat up the kid in the wheelchair who can’t defend himself,” DeVine told Shepard. That was the first time the 36-year-old ever felt a connection to comedy.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Andy Samberg's New Romantic Comedy Was Influenced By Star Wars</a></span></p><h2 id=a-blessing-in-disguise>A Blessing In Disguise</h2><p>His freak accident pretty much destroyed any possible future of making it into professional baseball for Adam DeVine. The actor, however, proves that he’s a trooper and doesn’t get discouraged easily. In his high school years, he developed a new talent for comedy and sought to pursue a career in the entertainment industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Whilst being temporarily handicapped, DeVine <a href=#>used that time to work on his newfound craft.</a> In continuation with his interview with Entertainment Weekly, the comedian said that he “started writing down jokes and even comedy skits” just as he did in grade school. The Modern Family actor even called into local radio stations, often performing characters over the air and even did impressions of the late 1960’s Christopher Farley. DeVine realized that he could make it big time.</p><p>Eventually, the star made a full recovery and moved from his hometown Nebraska to further pursue a career in entertainment in California. During the earlier parts of his career, DeVine spent time building his brand and finding his comedic style. He even collaborated on a few projects with his friends. DeVine got his first taste of real success through his “YouTube sketch shows with his group Mail Order Comedy.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The star credits his freak-childhood accident in helping him pursue a career in comedy. DeVine told Entertainment Weekly that he was luckier than most comedians in the industry. “A lot of comics say that something traumatic happened in their lives, that sort of pushes them in this direction . . . Some of their dads burned them with cigarettes and stuff. My dad just pushed me in a wheelchair, you know? It could be much worse. I just had a cement truck.” If it wasn’t for that freak accident, the world would’ve never learned of the great comedic power of Adam DeVine. It seems like a twist of faith, but sometimes good fortune is born out of life’s chaos.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweet Facts About Rebel Wilson And Adam Devine's Friendship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYnZmdYrGmwsinnGamlal6uLvRrZ9mpp%2Bserq71KeeZqyilrSmsNho</p></div><div id=links><a href=./tiger-wood-net-worth-investment-deals.html>&#171;&nbsp;Tiger Woods' Net Worth Was Partially Built By An Exclusive Investment Deal That Fans Are Unware Of</a>
