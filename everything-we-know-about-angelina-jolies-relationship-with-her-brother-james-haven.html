It wasn't long before the siblings were featured in all the tabloids. People were buzzing with questions. The most important question was - who is James Haven?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We can all agree that Angelina Jolie is a world-renowned actress who has made a name for herself through a career that has spanned decades. The same can't be said for her older brother, who is undoubtedly living in his sister's shadow, but he has made his own way in Hollywood. He's played an important supporting role in Angelina's life.</p><p>Despite her incredibly successful Hollywood career, the actress has faced a fair amount of drama and heartbreak. Her brother has been working behind the scenes to help her during her struggles.&nbsp;Let's take an in-depth look at everything we know about Angelina and James' relationship!</p><h2 id=james-haven-is-the-son-of-actors-jon-voight-and-marcheline-bertrand><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>James Haven Is The Son Of Actors&nbsp;Jon Voight And Marcheline Bertrand</span></h2><p>Jon Voight is an established, Oscar-winning Hollywood actor with a career that began in the 60s. He married actress, Marcheline Bertrand, in 1967 and the couple welcomed two children during their marriage. It’s no wonder that both Angelina and James embraced their acting roots and pursued careers in acting, producing, and directing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=james-and-angelina-have-a-strained-relationship-with-their-father-and-were-raised-by-their-mother><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>James And Angelina Have A Strained Relationship With Their Father And Were Raised By Their Mother</span></h2><p>Jon's marriage to Marcheline was short-lived and ended in divorce. At the time of their parents' divorce, James and Angelina were still children. Over the years, the siblings became estranged from their father. While they were living with their mother, James and Angelina became extremely close.</p><h2 id=james-and-angelina-s-mother-died-of-ovarian-cancer-in-2007><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>James And Angelina's Mother Died Of Ovarian Cancer In 2007</span></h2><p>Having been raised by their mother, it was a particularly heartbreaking moment for James and Angelina when they lost her to an eight-year-long cancer battle. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It was reported that</a> she passed peacefully, surrounded by her children and grandchildren. The siblings played an important role in supporting one another through this difficult time.</p><h2 id=the-siblings-have-shared-a-very-close-bond-since-childhood><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>The Siblings&nbsp;Have Shared A Very Close Bond Since Childhood</span></h2><p>Considering their parents strained relationship and their estrangement from their father, it’s no surprise that the siblings often relied on one another for comfort and friendship. The bond that they formed during childhood carried on well into their adult years. They have often been spotted attending events together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=after-becoming-estranged-from-their-father-the-siblings-both-legally-changed-their-last-names-to-their-middle-names><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>After Becoming Estranged From Their Father, The Siblings Both Legally Changed Their Last Names To Their Middle Names</span></h2><p>The rift between the siblings and their father went on and on. During the early 2000s, Jon made a public plea to reconcile with his daughter, Angelina,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">but reportedly made things worse</a>. Angelina and James decided to snub their father by dropping the surname, "Voight". They changed their last names to their middle names (Jolie and Haven, respectively).</p><h2 id=descended-from-a-family-of-actors-both-angelina-and-james-have-pursued-acting-careers><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Descended From A Family Of Actors, Both&nbsp;Angelina And James Have Pursued Acting Careers</span></h2><p>Being the children of a famous actor, Angelina and James were exposed to Hollywood life at very young ages. This seemed to have sparked their interest in pursuing careers in acting. Although Angelina‘s career overshadows James’, James Haven has never wavered in terms of offering support to Angie and being proud of her.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angelina Jolie: 20 Photos She Probably Regrets Today</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=james-acting-debut-was-in-the-movie-gia-in-which-his-sister-played-the-leading-role><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>James' Acting Debut Was In The Movie Gia, In Which His Sister Played The Leading Role</span></h2><p>In 1998, Angelina landed a leading role in the biographical film, Gia, which shared the life story of the late fashion model, Gia Carangi - this role arguably jump-started Angelina's career, as she received multiple prestigious awards, such as a Golden Globe and SAG Award. James also worked on the film and had a minor role as a background actor.</p><h2 id=angelina-thanked-james-during-her-acceptance-speech-after-winning-the-oscar-for-best-supporting-actress-in-girl-interrupted><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Angelina Thanked James During Her Acceptance Speech After Winning The Oscar For Best Supporting Actress In&nbsp;Girl, Interrupted</span></h2><p>It was undoubtedly a career-defining moment when Angelina won her first Oscar for her performance in Girl, Interrupted.

A memorable night for both of them!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Roles Angelina Jolie Should've Rejected (And The 5 Most Iconic)</a></span></p><h2 id=the-siblings-gained-worldwide-attention-for-famously-kissing-on-the-lips-during-the-2000-oscars><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Siblings Gained Worldwide Attention For Famously Kissing On The Lips During The 2000 Oscars</span></h2><p>We weren’t kidding when we said that this was a memorable night for the siblings...the morning after the Oscars, their kiss was covered by all tabloids. Both of them have spoken about the smooch. They've said that the kiss was innocent, but made out to be perverse by the public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=james-turned-his-career-around-in-pursuit-of-producing-and-directing-movies><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>James Turned His Career Around In Pursuit Of Producing And Directing Movies</span></h2><p>Unfortunately, James didn’t experience the same level of fame as his sister did. Despite booking roles in a variety of movies and television shows, his career as an actor more or less ground to a halt by 2014. Since then, James has developed an interest in producing and directing and has worked on a few films.</p><h2 id=james-proclaimed-he-was-a-born-again-christian-in-2009-and-trained-to-be-a-youth-minister><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>James Proclaimed He Was A Born-Again Christian In 2009 And Trained To Be A Youth Minister</span></h2><p>Despite&nbsp;expanding his career path into producing and directing, James sought further fulfillment in life and turned to religion to accomplish this.&nbsp;This happened shortly after the death of his mother, Marcheline.

The two were able to work through their differences. It was thanks to James that Angelina considered giving their&nbsp;father a second chance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angelina-hired-james-as-her-manny-and-he-took-on-the-role-of-helping-raise-his-six-nieces-and-nephews><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Angelina Hired James As Her "Manny" And He Took On&nbsp;The Role Of Helping Raise His Six&nbsp;Nieces And Nephews</span></h2><p>Before Angelina divorced Brad Pitt, she was feeling the strain of raising their six children while Brad was away working on several different acting projects.
