But why have they kept their relationship so secret if they are dating? Is there something these two stars don't want fans to know? Are they guarding a secret? Or is the situation more simple to explain?</p><h2 id=when-did-the-meghann-fahy-and-leo-woodall-dating-rumors-start>When Did The Meghann Fahy And Leo Woodall Dating Rumors Start?</h2><p><a href=#>The Meghann Fahy and Leo Woodall dating rumors</a> have been around since late 2022 and are not slowing down. There have been multiple instances where co-stars formed a great friendship or started dating (including Kaley Cuoco and Johnny Galecki, <a href=#>Lili Reinhart, and Cole Sprouse</a>, and Miley Cyrus and Lucas Till, to name a few). But despite being asked in multiple interviews what is going on, the alleged couple have dodged the questions or given cryptic answers (which, in a way, neither confirms nor denies what is going on between them).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Most Popular Shows Like You And The White Lotus Are Glorifying This Particular Type Of Theme</a></span></p><p>For example, instead of just saying, "no, nothing is happening at all," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fahy answered a question about her dating Woodall</a> with the response: "I don't kiss and tell." In the same interview on "Watch What Happens Live," host Andy Cohen asked if they were "friends with benefits," to which Fahy replied: "We're friends." For most people, this last comment would be enough to accept that the rumors are false and move on, but that has not slowed the speculation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/meghann-fahy-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But what else started the speculation? That could have something to do with Instagram, and the co-stars have posted images together and written what many people interpret as affection comments (although they can also be completely platonic).</p><p>In a post, Fahy allegedly commented: "I love you! I love these! I love you!" to which Woodhall responded: "Love you right back." But this is hardly definitive proof, as much as many of us would like it to be.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>White Lotus Season 3: What We Know About Plot, Location, And Characters</a></span></p><p>Plus, they need to be together to promote the show, so it only further fuels speculation when people see them, for example, on the red carpet at the 2023 Screen Actors Guild Awards.</p><h2 id=why-would-meghann-fahy-and-leo-woodall-want-to-keep-their-relationship-a-secret>Why Would Meghann Fahy And Leo Woodall Want To Keep Their Relationship A Secret?</h2><p>There is no definitive proof as to why Meghann Fahy and Leo Woodall would want to keep their alleged relationship a secret if they were dating, but there are some things to consider which make sense. First, actors dating each other after starring in a show is nothing new, but it can also be bad for business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is especially true if the stars break up while filming, and it can create awkward tension and a lack of chemistry. If the whole world is not focusing on the relationship, and it is not under a microscope, it can be much easier to forget about the whole thing and move on. It would be much harder having to read headlines about yourself and your former partner if you were heartbroken.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Who’s-In-HBO’s-‘White-Lotus’-Season-2-And-What-Are-They-Worth.jpg><p>Another reason could be the considerable age gap. Meghann Fahy was born on April 25, 1990, while Leo Woodhall is seven years her junior and was born on September 14, 1996. While seven years doesn't seem like that much later in life, it is entirely possible that they are in completely different phases right now, and it would be hard to maintain their relationship (if they are in one).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/leo-woodall-as-jack-in-white-lotus-season-2.jpg><p>Additionally, it's clear the couple wants to keep their private life private because it's no one's business but their own. We have witnessed all too many times the pressure that being in public has had on celebrity relationships, and this intensifies when they have come forward and confirmed they were an item.</p><h2 id=inside-meghann-fahy-and-leo-woodall-39-s-careers>Inside Meghann Fahy And Leo Woodall's Careers</h2><p>Meghann Fahy and Leo Woodall are up-and-coming stars who we expect to see much more of in the future. This could be another reason they don't want romance reports overshadowing their accomplishments. And they are certainly accomplishing a lot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/meghann-fahy.jpg><p>In an interview with Harper's Bazaar in 2022, Fahy spoke about her gratitude for landing a <a href=#>role as she did in White Lotus 2</a>. "I never planned to be an actor. So every single thing that comes my way is just something that I feel really lucky to have the opportunity to do," she said.</p><p>"I'm excited to see what's next. I've always been really into the actors that are in everything, but nobody really knows who they are. So you'll see them at the grocery store, and you're like, 'That's the girl from the... wait, what did we see her in?' I don't have big dreams of winning fancy awards or being a famous person. I just love making things."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jennifer Coolidge's Brutally Honest Thoughts About What Happens To Tanya In The White Lotus</a></span></p><p>What else can we gather from their interviews? Truthfully, not much. Meghann Fahy was asked about <a href=#>people she bonded with while filming White Lotus</a> 2 in an interview with Glamour, and her response did mention Leo Woodhall, but she called him her friend. Interesting, isn't it?</p><p>Here is what she said: "I made a few friends! Which, I always say, if you just meet one person that you really click with, that's a win, but yeah, a few people that I'm really close with. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leo Woodall and I are really good friends</a>; Adam DiMarco; we see Haley [Lu Richardson] all the time. Aubrey [Plaza] 's super busy, so I don't see her very often. I just truly love every single person that I got to work with…" It is entirely possible that these two stars are exactly what they say they are: friends!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdorKotMCnpWaekZ3GbrjEqGSwp5%2BZrq24jKucpZmknryvv8eip2aZXaiypL7ErWSanqSav265xJ6roqaXYryvedahoK2dXaG8tcHSZqqemaOku25%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./why-is-the-game-feuding-with-eminem.html>&#171;&nbsp;The Real Reason The Game Is Feuding With Eminem</a>
