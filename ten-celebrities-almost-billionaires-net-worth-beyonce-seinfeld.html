The Irish rock legend is worth a cool<strong> $700 million and growing. Poised to become a billionaire</strong>, the “Discotheque” singer has made his fortune with major hit albums, world tours, entering the hotel business, as well as being on the board of a private equity called Elevation Partners. With the entrepreneurial spirit (not to mention a kind spirit, which was on full display <a href=#>when he released his first song in three years dedicated to the people of Italy</a>), Bono will likely see a billion sooner rather than later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> Is Jenna Marbles Still Worth $8 Million?

However, Trump has generated her own fortune, amassing a net worth of<strong> $800 million</strong>,<strong> just short of the coveted billion dollars. </strong>Through modeling, a line of handbags and footwear, her own jewelry company, and a series of other economic ventures, Ivanka has money for days. With a line of women's workwear which quickly hit $100 million in annual revenue, Trump seems like she will be a billion in no time.
