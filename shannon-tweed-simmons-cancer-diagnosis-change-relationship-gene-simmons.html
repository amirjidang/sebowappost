During the episode, viewers learned that Simmons' longtime girlfriend at the time, Shannon Tweed Simmons, went through a cancer scare.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Everything-Shannon-Tweed-Is-Really-Doing-Now.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Around the time that episode aired, Simmons and Tweed Simmons appeared on the daytime show, The Doctors. Tweed Simmons described to the camera the moment that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she came to believe that she might be suffering from breast cancer</a>.</p><p>"I never had a connection to breast cancer until six of my friends were touched by it and then I had a scare myself. My sister and I went shopping... and um, we were trying on clothes and I noticed a little lump on my breast and she agreed with me that I should get it checked out, and we did."</p><p>As footage from Gene Simmons Family Jewels revealed, Tweed Simmons' doctor told her the lump had to be taken seriously. According to her doctor, the lump was, "not something that someone who's postmenopausal should just suddenly have in her breasts."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/carrot-top-got-an-exclusive-tour-of-gene-simmons-warehouse-but-things-took-a-turn-when-he-told-simmons-he-never-heard-of-kiss.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Carrot Top Got An Exclusive Tour Of Gene Simmons' Warehouse, But Things Took A Turn When He Told Simmons He Never Heard Of KISS</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Gene Simmons' reaction to Carrot Top's reveal was not a positive one, and things took an awkward turn.</span><p>After examining the actor, Tweed Simmons' doctor ordered a biopsy which thankfully revealed that she didn't have cancer. However, that kind of test result doesn't come back immediately, which meant that Tweed Simmons and Simmons were left wondering.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Simmons and Tweed Simmons were forced to worry about her health, that begs an obvious question; how did that affect their relationship? During their aforementioned appearance on The Doctors, Simmons described how he felt about Tweed Simmons' health scare. Early during their segment, Simmons admitted how scared he felt.</p><p>"Yeah, that was scary because Shannon is always taking care of her health, and she watches her diet, and the more I learned about it, the more I found out the scary facts."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/shannon-tweed-gene-simmons-1.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout the majority of the rest of the segment, Simmons remained silent. Given Simmons' infamously over-the-top personality, that was out of character for the rock star.</p><p>However, when the segment was almost over, Simmons spoke directly into the camera and addressed the male viewers. Given what Simmons said and how passionate he was, it seemed like Tweed Simmons' cancer scare really affected him.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/did-paul-reubens-ego-ruin-his-relationship-with-david-bowie-before-they-both-died-of-cancer_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did Paul Reubens' Ego Ruin His Relationship With David Bowie Before They Both Died Of Cancer?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Pee-wee Herman star Paul Reubens turned down David Bowie's offer to work together for an amazing reason.</span><p>"I have to tell the men something. You know, I haven't said a word here. I know my place, but it's a really important point. What's happened recently as women have sort of gathered up the courage to speak to each other on shows like this and it's really important. Women talk to women about the important issues about women. But, this is a word to men out there. The person you care about enough to live with and support and do all this stuff, put pressure on her. Make her, sometimes we all get laxed, make her understand that her health is every bit as important to you and your family as to her. And force her to go [get checked out]."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/gene-simmons-and-shannon-tweed-simmons-looking-close.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to a She Knows Gene Simmons Family Jewels recap, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Simmons and Tweed Simmons tried to avoid chemicals in the aftermath of her cancer scare</a>. However, that is the kind of thing that happens on reality shows that often seem to be fake.</p><p>In 2014, Gene Simmons' bandmate Paul Stanley told Rolling Stone that he never appeared on Gene Simmons Family Jewels <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">because it wasn't real</a> . “Because it wasn’t reality. To create a life that isn’t accurate and for me to be a part of it, or to help you promote something that I think is questionable...and, quite honestly, waste my time? You’re missing out on living a real life if you’re filming a fake one.”</p><p>What is very real, however, is what happened after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shannon Tweed's cancer scare was first revealed to the public in March 2010</a>. On October 1, 2011, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shannon Tweed Simmons and Gene Simmons got married</a> after dating each other for more than 27 years.</p><h2 id=are-gene-simmons-and-shannon-tweed-simmons-still-married>Are Gene Simmons And Shannon Tweed Simmons Still Married?</h2><p>After Gene Simmons and Shannon Tweed Simmons got married in 2011, many observers wondered if it would last. While the couple had been together for 27 years by that point, their relationship had been dramatic at times, including when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she walked out on a joint interview</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/gene-simmons-took-all-heat-for-shannon-tweed-walking-out-of-their-interview-but-joy-behar-was-really-the-one-that-should-ve-been-blamed.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Gene Simmons Took All Heat For Shannon Tweed Walking Out Of Their Interview, But Joy Behar Was Really The One That Should've Been Blamed</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Gene Simmons made a harsh remark that caused Shannon Tweed to walkout, but it might've been setup by Joy Behar.</span><p>On top of the infamous interview walkout, Tweed Simmons revealed in 2013 that she almost left Simmons. During a YouTube video, Tweed Simmons spoke to Ron and Tina Konkin about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">why she came close to leaving Simmons</a>.</p><p>"I told Gene that, you know, I'm aware of certain events and I really don't want to have this relationship anymore. I'm willing to have a relationship with you, but not this one. And so, you know, he agreed to work on it,"</p><p>More recently, in 2023, Gene Simmons spoke to The Guardian about his relationship with Simmons. During this interview, Simmons stated that if Tweed Simmons cheated on him, as he had done in the past to her, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he wouldn't leave her</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/gene-simmons-and-shannon-tweed-simmons-looking-happy.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Would I ever leave if Shannon dilly-dallied like I had?
