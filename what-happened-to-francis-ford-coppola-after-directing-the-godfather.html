helmed <a href=#>The Godfather</a>, one of the most popular film series ever made. The Godfather, which came out in 1972, earned Coppola the respect and esteem of millions, but what happened after the movie?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Marlon Brando's Life Was Never The Same After The Godfather</a></span></p><p>Before The Godfather, Coppola got his start directing knock-off movies for <a href=#>B-movie mogul Roger Corman</a>. After The Godfather he was a critically acclaimed director and a member of the big four, a quartet of directors that consists of him, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, and Martin Scorsese. His legacy lives on in his family too, as his daughter Sophia Coppola is a popular writer and director now too. This is the great filmmaker's life after he gave the world the movie that made Al Pacino's career.</p><h2 id=he-directed-the-conversation><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>He Directed The Conversation</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In between The Godfather and The Godfather Part II, Coppola worked with Harrison Ford in one of his pre-Star Wars films. The Conversation stars Gene Hackman as a surveillance expert, who overhears and records a cryptic conversation between two lovers, that might have nefarious ends. The film features some of the actors Coppola directed in The Godfather, like Robert Duvall and John Cazale.</p><h2 id=he-directed-the-godfather-part-ii><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He Directed The Godfather Part II</span></h2><p>The Godfather was a phenomenal success, but many wanted to see more of the Corleone family, and they especially wanted to learn how Don Corleone became the influential man he was. This drove Coppola to write and direct The Godfather Part II, which brought back all of the film's original cast, save for Marlon Brando. However, we see the story of Brando's character and his rise to power, a youthful Robert DeNiro played the young Don.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How 'The Godfather Part 2' Inspired 'Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again'</a></span></p><h2 id=he-directed-apocalypse-now><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Directed Apocalypse Now</span></h2><p>With the two Godfather movies, Coppola was now in high demand. In the wake of his popularity, he decided to direct his magnum opus, Apocalypse Now. The story is a loose adaptation of Joseph Conrad's classic story Heart of Darkness, and it follows Cpt. Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) as he hunts down the deranged Lt. Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando. The film also features Harrison Ford, Robert Duvall, and Dennis Hopper.</p><h2 id=the-production-for-apocalypse-now-was-a-legendary-nightmare><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>The Production For Apocalypse Now Was A Legendary Nightmare</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Coppola got Apocalypse Now thanks to his popularity, many argue that Coppola got a little too presumptuous with how much influence he had, and how patient Hollywood would be with him. The production of Apocalypse Now was a notorious nightmare. The biggest setback was Typhon Olga, which hit the filming location and destroyed several sets, setting back production by two months.</p><p>This and Coppola's increasingly erratic temperament, and Brando's too (this was around the time Brando started his now famous bizarre on-set behavior). Brando was so temperamental that he demanded he is filmed with very specific lighting and with <a href=#>vaseline-coated lenses </a>to hide the fact he had gained weight. Fortunately for the film world, the film was eventually completed and many consider it to be Coppola's best.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Facts About Al Pacino's Role In 'The Godfather'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-daughter-became-a-filmmaker><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>His Daughter Became A Filmmaker</span></h2><p>Coppola's career was never quite the same after Apocalypse Now, he still directed and wrote but no film that came after this one was quite as sensational. True, Bram Stroker's Dracula and The Outsiders were popular hits, but they never got the director the degree of prestige he had in the past. Coppola is still making films, but he has slowed down a bit as his daughter, Sofia Coppola, stepped up. Sofia Coppola has directed films such as The Virgin Suicides, Marie Antoinette, and Lost In Translation. She also acted in some of her father's films, even as a baby, she was baby Michael Rizzi in the iconic baptism scene in The Godfather.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-started-a-winery><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Started A Winery</span></h2><p>With help from his daughter, the director ventured into many ventures which honor his Italian heritage, and it can't get more Italian than wine. Coppola started the Francis Ford Coppola Winery, which operates out of Sonoma County. They remain one of the most widely distributed wines to come out of Northern California wine country.</p><h2 id=he-made-a-third-godfather-film><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He Made A Third Godfather Film</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After nearly 20 years after Michael Corleone had officially taken over the family business, Coppola returned to their story with The Godfather Part III. Unlike the first two films, it was not very well received by fans or critics and is not included in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American Film Institute's top 100 lists</a>. Many argue the film was unnecessary and was a desperate attempt by Coppola to remain relevant as a director.</p><h2 id=he-opened-a-cafe><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He Opened A Cafe</span></h2><p>Although The Godfather Part III did not do as well as Coppola had hoped, he continued and continues now to write and direct and create. He also has other business ventures besides his winery. He also opened CafÃ© Zoetrope, named for his production company, in San Francisco. The cafÃ© has an almost perfect rating in reviews on Google.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-presented-martin-scorsese-his-oscar><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>He Presented Martin Scorsese His Oscar</span></h2><p>Coppola was a part of Hollywood history in more ways than just his films. He helped start George Lucas's career with the creation of American Zoetrope and in turn produced Lucas' earliest films before Star Wars. In a way, without Coppola, there would be no Star Wars. Also, as a member of the big four, he was one of the first to win his Oscar. When his friend and contemporary Martin Scorsese, the last of the big four to win a statue, got his chance in 2006 with The Departed, Coppola, along with Lucas and Spielberg, presented Scorsese with his long overdue award.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brLRmqWcoaNis7C%2Bw2aaqKigpLmiecCfq56qXZm2s7HCraCnn12ptaZ5xqibn5mknbKzew%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./which-the-hangover-star-has-the-highest-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Which 'The Hangover' Star Has The Highest Net Worth?</a>
