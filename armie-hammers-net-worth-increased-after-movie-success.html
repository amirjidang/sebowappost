His breakthrough film role came in the 2010 film, The Social Network, which dramatized the real life events behind the founding of Facebook by Mark Zuckerburg.

Against a budget of $40 million, the movie more than quadrupled its box office sales, earning $224.9 million internationally. It's been reported that lead actors like Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, and Justin Timberlake took home a salary of $1 million, $500,000, and $750,000 respectively. So, it's safe to say that Hammer took home an estimated salary of between $100-$300,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li>Box office sales: $224.9 million</li><li>Character played: Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss</li></ul><h2 id=what-was-armie-hammer-39-s-salary-for-the-lone-ranger><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>What Was Armie Hammer's Salary For The Lone Ranger?</span></h2><h3 id=armie-hammer-39-s-salary-1-to-2-million>Armie Hammer's Salary: $1 to $2 million</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/armie-hammer-at-the-on-the-basis-of-sex-press-conference-2018.jpg><p>Despite struggling to find his footing in the entertainment industry <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Armie Hammer had a net worth of $10 million at one point</a> in his career, thanks to his many movie roles.

The film was based on the fairy tale, Snow White, and Hammer plays the significant role of Prince Alcott of Valencia, the famous protagonist who meets Snow White in the forest and falls in love with her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mirror Mirror can hardly be considered as one of Armie Hammer's successes as it grossed $183 million against a budget of $85 million. According to sources, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a film has to earn at least twice its budget at the box office</a> to cover promotional costs. And because this film failed to do so, there was only $13 million left over after production and promotional costs were considered. So, it's more than likely that Hammer was again paid a salary of between $500,000 to $1 million.</p><ul><li>Film budget: $85 million</li><li>Character played: Prince Alcott</li></ul><h2 id=what-was-armie-hammer-39-s-salary-for-j-edgar><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>What Was Armie Hammer's Salary For J.

Hammer and DiCaprio co-starred in the biographical film, J. Edgar, which was released in 2011. While DiCaprio played the lead role of the first Director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, Hammer played the FBI's Associate Director, Clyde Tolson.</p><p>Like some of Armie Hammer's previous films, the cast agreed to take a major pay cut to fulfill their roles. Leonardo DiCaopriom, for example, took a 90% pay cut and received a salary of just $2 million, which is much less than his standard acting fee of $20 million. Hammer, whose basic acting fee was $1 million, might've also taken a pay cut, settling for an estimated salary of $150,000 to $300,000.</p><ul><li>Film budget: $35 million</li><li>Director: Clint Eastwood</li></ul><h2 id=what-was-armie-hammer-39-s-salary-for-death-on-the-nile><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What Was Armie Hammer's Salary For Death On The Nile?</span></h2><h3 id=armie-hammer-39-s-salary-175k>Armie Hammer's Salary: $175k</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/untitled-design-60.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of Armie Hammer's most recent films was the 2022 mystery film, Death on the Nile.
