quickly became one of the most famous couples in Hollywood. The actors first worked together on the 2003 film Mr. & Mrs. Smith, in which they played a married couple. Pitt was still married to Jennifer Aniston, while Jolie was enjoying single motherhood after splitting from ex-husband Billy Bob Thornton. Before April 2012, when they finally announced their engagement, <a href=#>their family had grown to include six children, three of whom were adopted.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Brad Pitt Isn't Happy With Angelina Jolie Over The Winery Lawsuit</a></span></p><p>The duo made two movies, got through some rough patches, and built quite the real estate portfolio as a couple thanks to their insane net worths. At the time of this writing, Brad Pitt is worth $300 million and Angelina Jolie is worth $120 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. The couple had homes in three different countries,<a href=#> from a sprawling estate in France</a> to a historic home in New Orleans. Although they have parted and are battling it out in court over their children and possessions, no one can deny that the couple shared several gorgeous homes during their prime. So, let's look at the Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie property portfolio and see why it was so impressive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inside-brad-pitt-and-angelina-jolie-39-s-french-quarter-mansion>Inside Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolie's French Quarter Mansion</h2><p>This 7,000-square-foot, five-bedroom, five-bathroom mansion (which also contains a two-story guest house) was purchased by Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt in late 2006 while the actor was in town filming The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-french-quarter-mansion.jpg><p>The home's interior boasts a mix of old and new, with exquisite touches like Venetian plaster walls, a spiral staircase, and marble mantels next to modern conveniences like an elevator. The main house of this quaint residence has four bedrooms, four full bathrooms, and two half bathrooms, as <a href=#>the Los Angeles Times reported.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/_brad-and-angelina-properties.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite constructing a guesthouse that doubled the number of bedrooms to five, the house was still relatively small for the well-known family of eight. However, the Jolie-Pitts were excellent hosts, having welcomed celebrity pals like Jonah Hill, who stayed at the mansion for a month while filming 21 Jump Street. Fellow actor Matthew McConaughey also has a house directly across the street.</p><p>In 2016, the celebrity couple who had initially paid $3.5 million for the estate built in the 1830s sold it for $4.9 million. This deal closed a little over a month after Jolie's September 2016 divorce filing, in which she cited "irreconcilable differences" as the basis for ending the marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=where-were-angelina-jolie-and-brad-pitt-39-s-kids-raised>Where Were Angelina Jolie And Brad Pitt's Kids Raised?</h2><p>Pitt purchased a property in Los Feliz, amid the Hollywood hills, for $1.7 million (£1.5m) in 1994, three years after his breakout appearance in Thelma & Louise and the same year he made Legends of the Fall and Interview with a Vampire.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Are-Brad-Pitt-And-Angelina-Jolie-On-Speaking-Terms.jpg><p>Pitt eventually purchased the two homes next to each other over the subsequent few years and two more in 2005 after getting together with Angelina Jolie. This compound of five homes on 1.9 acres features the main house, Briarcliff Manor.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Did Brad Pitt Loan Angelina Jolie $8 Million And Charge Her Interest?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>In a 2017 interview with GQ</a>, Brad Pitt referred to the property as his children's "childhood house," saying that it featured a large outdoor swimming pool, a private tennis court, a skate park, and nanny quarters.</p><h2 id=how-much-did-brad-pitt-and-angelina-jolie-spend-on-ch-acirc-teau-miraval>How Much Did Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolie Spend On Château Miraval?</h2><p>In August 2014, Pitt and Jolie tied the knot in a secret ceremony at the Romanesque chapel of Château Miraval, one of the most spectacular estates the pair has purchased together. The couple rented the building in 2008 for a total of three years before purchasing it for $60 million (£52.7m) in 2012.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cha-teau-miraval.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The expansive property comprises a total area of one thousand acres and several buildings dating back to the 17th century. In addition, there is a lake, 20 different fountains, and a vineyard actively being farmed. It is said that Pitt has left his mark on the house, which includes 35 bedrooms, a swimming pool, a billiards room, a screening room, twin gyms, a sauna, a Jacuzzi, and a banquet hall. In addition, the property has a screening room.</p><p>The pair continued the family heritage of making wine, thereby starting Miraval Wines in 2013. When Pitt and Jolie split up after an incident on their private jet, Pitt continued to be heavily involved with the company, creating his Fleur de Miraval rosé champagne, which was shared at the Oscars in 2022.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Angelina Jolie Immediately File For Divorce After The Plane Drama With Brad Pitt?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cha-teau-miraval-brad-and-angelina.png><p>The former couple is currently involved in a contentious dispute due to Jolie's decision to sell her share.

When he got with Angelina Jolie, their whole family utilized it as a vacation home, enjoying activities like horseback riding on the property's 11.5-acre expanse and day visits to the neighboring beach. In recent years, he's made it a regular base to host his Missouri relatives during their LA visits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp5%2BVobavrYyjpqWhlWK7psCMsKarrJhir7Otw2anoqykYr%2BmrctmnKyskamybrTOrqqeq18%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./how-does-addison-rae-spend-5-million-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;How Does Addison Rae Spend Her $5 Million Net Worth?</a>
