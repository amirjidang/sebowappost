class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thanks to lucrative endorsement deals and long-running contracts to appear on shows such as The Voice, Christina has branched out into other things aside from singing that have earned her millions of dollars in revenue besides the money she makes from her music career.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Britney Spears Calls Out Christina Aguilera For Dodging Conservatorship Question</a></span></p><p>For a woman who has been so successful, it’s hard to believe that <a href=#>Britney Spears is only worth $60 million</a> — then again, Christina being worth $160 million is just as shocking, but how exactly was X-tina able to surpass her frenemy’s fortune?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated on November 20, 2021, by Michael Chaar:</strong> Britney Spears is easily one of the biggest names in the music industry, and rightfully so! After selling millions of albums worldwide, touring across the globe, and rising to icon status, being deemed the Pop Princess and all, it's no surprise <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was once worth $215 million</a>. Well, her net worth is now estimated at $60 million. Fans are confused as to how this all came to be, but more importantly, how her biggest career rival, Christina Aguilera, is worth $100 million more than her. Well, it seems as if Christina's work on The Voice, many albums, Vegas residency, and acting roles have allowed her to make so much. While Britney would have been worth more than Xtina, her restrictive conservatorship cost her millions, bringing her net worth way down!</p><h2 id=christina-aguilera-rsquo-s-music-career>Christina Aguilera’s Music Career</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While she had been pretty lengthy breaks from the music industry to focus her attention on raising her children, Max and Summer Rain, Christina made an impactful return to the charts when she dropped her eighth studio album Liberation in June 2018.</p><p>The record featured production work from the likes of Anderson, Paak, Kanye West, and even Lewis Hamilton, while publications such as Rolling Stone and The Observer had given the project an overall four out of five stars.</p><h2 id=christina-landed-a-vegas-residency>Christina Landed A Vegas Residency</h2><p>Liberation paved the way for Christina to get back on the road with The Liberation Tour, which consisted of one leg in North America and 21 shows. That was followed by the announcement that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christina had landed her very own residency</a> at the Zappos Theater in Las Vegas that was set to run from May 2019 to March 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With over 75,000 people attending the show during its one-year run, Christina accumulated an impressive $10.2 million at the box office during which she would also embark on The X Tour, which comprised 15 shows in Europe and three shows in Mexico.</p><p>Needless to say, Christina was certainly putting in the work to collectively bring in more than enough money from her music career alone.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Christina Aguilera Branded A "Flop" Amid New Album News</a></span></p><h2 id=christina-aguilera-joined-the-voice>Christina Aguilera Joined The Voice</h2><p>The “Fighter” vocalist has also made a good chunk of her fortune from reality TV, after having inked a lucrative deal with NBC to join the likes of Adam Levine, CeeLo Green, and Blake Shelton on the first season of NBC’s talent show The Voice.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to reports, while producers had no idea whether people would gravitate towards the competition series, they were feeling to throw a lot of money into production costs, which included a fee between $17 million to $20 million just to get X-tina on board.</p><p>Taking that into consideration, Christina did six seasons on the show before deciding to leave following Series 10, so that means she could’ve easily bagged herself around $100 million for her time on the judging panel.</p><h2 id=christina-aguilera-also-appeared-in-films>Christina Aguilera Also Appeared In Films</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And while Christina was never shy to admit that the job to critique contestants was very rewarding, she soon realized that being part of The Voice was no longer a priority of hers — particularly as the format continuously changed every time she would return for another season, however, she's also been busy appearing on the big screen.</p><p>In 2017, Christina starred as Akiko Glitter in the family flick, The Emoji Movie. She also played Jewels in the 2018 indie movie Jewels. Her biggest role as an actress (to date) was starring opposite pop icon Cher in 2010’s Burlesque where she played a small-town girl who moves to Los Angeles and finds a life-changing opportunity in a club run by a former dancer.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britney Spears Fans Worry About The Star After She Acts ‘Childlike’ In New IG Video</a></span></p><h2 id=britney-lost-millions-due-to-her-conservatorship>Britney Lost Millions Due To Her Conservatorship</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2008, Britney Spears was officially put under a conservatorship by her father, Jamie Spears, who has overseen her finances, and person for a whopping 13 years. Well, it turns out that Jamie wasn't always fair when it came to Britney's millions. Despite releasing four studio albums, appearing on The X Factor, and having a residency of her own,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Britney's millions were allegedly taken from her</a> and pocketed by Jamie and the many people behind Spears' restrictive conservatorship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 'Toxic' singer was once worth a whopping $215 million, however, after the mishandling of her fortune, it appears as if her net worth has drastically reduced! Now, Britney is officially a free woman and will have total control over her own person and finances, so, perhaps Britney's net worth will be on a steady rise moving forward.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:<a href=#>Here's What Fans Think Of Christina Aguilera's Music Evolution</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhknKCinsC1tc2aZJqfpZ65pr7AZqWerF2svLPAx2ZoaWhdoratuMiopWaln6eybsDHmqVmmqKewa%2Bx2GaqqZ2Rp8Bw</p></div><div id=links><a href=./logan-lermans-success-story.html>&#171;&nbsp;How Logan Lerman's Became A Hollywood Star</a>
