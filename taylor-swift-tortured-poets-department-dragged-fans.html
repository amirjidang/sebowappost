But so many songs were filled with barbs aimed at self-proclaimed fans who also dragged Taylor for her choices and judged things they didn't understand. At least, that's how it felt as fans listened to the album for the first time. Here's why Taylor Swift's 11th album is absolutely unhinged, and why fans deserve a tongue lashing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-39-s-lyrics-on-the-tortured-poets-department-cut-deep>Taylor's Lyrics On The Tortured Poets Department Cut Deep</h2><p>Taylor seemed to speak directly to fans during various songs on TTPD, but it was deserved. Amid <a href=# rel=nofollow>tracks that fans think are about Matty Healy</a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow>Easter eggs referring to Joe Alwyn cheating</a>, Taylor gave fans a tongue lashing that... they actually kind of love, but also earned.</p><h3 id=quot-but-daddy-i-love-him-quot-mdash-we-the-fans-are-quot-daddy-quot>"But Daddy I Love Him" — We the fans are "Daddy"</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/aylor-swift-and-matty-healy-s-midnights-songs-were-never-released-front-back-_-commons-licenses.jpg><p>Skipping right to the crux of Taylor's commentary, track six "But Daddy I Love Him" was full of scolding from Taylor. Fans assumed that the song was about Taylor's relationship with Matty Healy, but instead of the song addressing her actual father or friends and family, the lyrics seemed to address fans' criticisms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I'll tell you something right now</p><p>I'd rather burn my whole life down</p><p>Than listen to one more second of all this b****ing and moaning</p><p>I'll tell you something about my good name</p><p>It's mine alone to disgrace</p><p>I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing</p><p>— "But Daddy I Love Him"</p><p>A sampling of the lyrics had fans on Reddit shocked-Pikachu-face in the comments. This was also one of the first tracks that had fans exclaiming that Taylor was "unhinged," with one comment flatly stating, "I hate that it’s about Matty but I love how unhinged it is."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The lyrics "I'm having his baby... no I'm not, but you should see your faces" also felt like a DIRECT accusation against fans who freaked out when Taylor seemed to confirm she was dating Matty Healy, and it was SUPER SERIOUS.</p><p>One fan summed up, "This song isn't about Matty, it's about how suffocating it is to live a life where people judge everything you do and disguise it as 'wanting the best for her.' The example of Matty is just the poetic vehicle to carry this point!"</p><h3 id=quot-guilty-as-sin-quot-mdash-taylor-hated-hiding-matty-from-fans>"Guilty as Sin?" — Taylor hated hiding Matty from fans</h3><p>Fans' thoughts were mixed on "Guilty As Sin?" but most seemed to think it was about Matty Healy, again because of Taylor's comments to her audience. She took a page out of the Bible with "roll the stone away" and "they're gonna crucify me anyway," which fans correlated directly with her Matty Healy relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What if I roll the stone away?</p><p>They're gonna crucify me anyway</p><p>What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?</p><p>If long suffering propriety is what they want from me</p><p>They don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly</p><p>I choose you and me, religiously</p><p>— "Guilty as Sin?"</p><p>This is another metaphor for Taylor worrying about what fans would say, and sticking to "propriety" for our sake. Of course, many fans also thought that "Guilty as Sin?"</p><h3 id=quot-i-can-do-it-with-a-broken-heart-quot-mdash-starting-the-eras-tour-post-joe>"I Can Do It With A Broken Heart" — Starting the Eras tour post-Joe</h3><p>One fan wrote of "Guilty as Sin?" "OK, I’m getting concerned almost every song she’s talking about [self harm] thoughts," a vibe that continued through other songs as they became, as some fans suggested, progressively "unhinged."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/screen-shot-2024-02-24-at-11-50-16-am.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift Feels “Safe And Protected” With Travis Kelce After Revealing Details Of Joe Alwyn’s Cheating</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor feels secure in her relationship with Travis after being cheated on by Joe, or at least she seems to be hinting at.</span><p>By the time we got to "I Can Do It With A Broken Heart," many fans suddenly had the same realization: Taylor was SAD when she started the Eras tour, and she hid it so well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She essentially says this in the song, but at the same time, she also seems to be dragging fans for the expectation that she would be perfectly fine after ending a six-year relationship that, TTPD seems to suggest, involved Taylor being cheated on.</p><p>'Cause I'm a real tough kid</p><p>I can handle my shit</p><p>They said, "Babe, you gotta fake it till you make it" And I did</p><p>Lights, camera, b***, smile</p><p>In stilettos for miles</p><p>— "I Can Do It With A Broken Heart"</p><p>Not that Taylor exactly had a choice, since she ostensibly booked the Eras tour before Joe (we assume) broke her heart.
