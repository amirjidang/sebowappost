He dominates the music industry with his innate ability to promote talent and has been the driving force behind some of the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> biggest music acts of our current time.</a> With a current net worth of $400 million, it's not just Scooter Braun's involvement in music that keeps him at the top of his game. He also has proven to be a risk-taker that has had some incredibly lucrative investments in other industries as well. Scooter Braun is able to enjoy living a lavish lifestyle while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">continuing to make money while he sleeps.</a> Even with this enormous wealth he has already acquired, this 39-year-old is showing now signs of slowing down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wealthy Genius</a> reports on Braun's continued involvement in investments and recent acquisitions that suggest the next few years may prove to be his strongest yet. Let's take a look at Scooter Braun's adventures to see how he builds his empire...</p><h2 id=music-management>Music Management</h2><p>Scooter Braun's number one claim to fame is most definitely his knack at music management. Starting at a young age, he was keen on throwing parties and began in the scene by becoming a prominent party planner. He took his skills to the next level when he happened to attract Jermaine Dupri and Janet Jackson to his events. Dupri ended up hiring him to work at So So Def and Braun quickly rose to the position of Vice President of Marketing. After a failed relationship there it was actually Lil Jon that suggested that Scooter take his talents and start his own agency.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a shocking twist, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Money Inc </a>reports that the next step Scooter took was the one that forever changed the landscape of music scouting. He happened to come across Justin Bieber's song clip on YoutTube, and he decided to scout him. This may sound like a normal process now, but at the time, throwing blind trust in talent found online was simply unheard of.&nbsp; After paying for 12 year old Justin and his mother to come to the United States,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Scooter Braun cultivated Bieber's career</a>, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>Scooter began scooping up other talents and became known as the go-to resource for identifying and helping to manage and refine musical talent. He is the man behind many big names, yet sit quietly in the background while his stars rise to fame. Some of the biggest names Scooter has under his belt include; Ariana Grande, Kanye West, and Tori Kelly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For those who may be unaware of how the earnings of a talent manager work, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Money Inc</a> reports that Scooter Braun is paid a very lucrative salary for the overall management of each artist, and he then "gets paid a commission on the gross payment that the artist receives."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Bieber's Million-Dollar Homes</a></span></p><h2 id=big-spotify-bucks>Big Spotify Bucks</h2><p>Much of Scooter Braun's wealth seems to be generated when he listens to his gut feeling and takes some chances. When Braun was listed on Billboard's 30 under 30 list he obtained the contact information for others that were named there. He then connected with the founder of Spotify and became an early investor. The company's baseline in the world of music seemed like a great fit for Scooter who was already thriving in that industry. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify earns money hand over fist</a>, which means Scooter Braun does, too.</p><h2 id=early-uber-investor>Early Uber Investor</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The success of Uber is undeniable now, but in true Scooter Braun fashion, he had no idea of the company's potential when he first become an investor.&nbsp; In fact, Scooter was sent home in an Uber at one point, and the fact that he didn't have to pay for the ride really sparked his curiosity about the service. He arranged a meeting with the co-founder and ended up investing in the business early on. Taking a risk on the company which was new and unheard of at the time, Scooter Braun invested in<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Uber's car service program</a> and with the huge stake he has in the now wildly successful company he wound up way on top, with huge earnings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-own-holdings-company>His Own Holdings Company</h2><p>With various income streams generating lots of money for Braun, he decided to establish his own holdings company which he later named Ithaca Holdings LLC. This is when really big things started happening for Braun, many of which made the headlines for their level of controversy. Ithaca a holdings invested in Big Machine Records, and Braun paid out a jaw dropping $300 million for<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the takeover.</a> Business isn't always an agreeable game, and this caused a huge uproar in Taylor Swift's world. This made Braun the owner of the first 6 of her albums and gave him rights to the music of huge names such as Florida Georgia Line, Lady Antebellum and Sheryl Crow. Taylor Swift was enraged and felt her musical rights were being not just infringed, but also exploited, and the two remain at odds today.</p><h2 id=when-you-re-this-big-anything-is-possible>When You're This Big, Anything Is Possible</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That old adage that it takes money to make money seemed to ring true for Braun, who has been throwing cash around and watching it multiply for years. He has so many avenues that generate income that the list is too vast to include them all. He has made millions by flipping real estate, brokered a deal between Ludacris and Pontiac that padded his pockets with another $12 million and worked with Usher to create RBMG, also known as Raymond-Braun Media Group, which later signed Ariana Grande. He has even joined forces with the founder of Marvel Studios and has created Mythos Studios, which is poised to create movies that are based on comic books.</p><h2 id=cannabis-control>Cannabis Control</h2><p>Nothing is out of reach for Scooter Braun, whose most recent business venture sees him poised to make some green with green! He has become a huge investor in a huge merger with Parallel, investing $22 million in this public deal. Partnering with the William Wrigley, the heir to the Wrigley Gum empire, Scooter Braun's takeover in the world of medicinal cannabis is sure to be a massive source of additional wealth for the already-powerful mogul.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Music Mogul Scooter Braun Expands His Wealth In Cannabis Products</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Money Inc.</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wealthy Genius</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pop Buzz</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTApLvOrZyrZZKnrra6jJqkmqujmrFuss6rq66mlWQ%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./heres-who-gets-a-birthday-cake-from-tom-cruise-every-year.html>&#171;&nbsp;Here's Who Gets A Birthday Cake From Tom Cruise Every Year</a>
