Some think it is a response to the fact that several influential rappers are dying from diabetes, liver failure, and drug overdoses. Heavy D, Nate Dogg, and Chris Kelly from the Kris Kross duo all died preventable deaths.</p><p>But Snoop doesn’t need dead friends to decide to lead a more healthy lifestyle. He has plenty of other reasons to avoid the sauce other than his health, which is still a good reason for anyone to cut back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-previous-drinking-escapades><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>His Previous Drinking Escapades</span></h2><p>Snoop himself admits that he started drinking as a “fashion statement.” One old enough to remember the gangsta rap explosion of the 90s and early 00s remembers how popular a look it was to wear baggie jeans and jerseys while drinking 40 oz. beers. Snoop, like most other rappers of his time, contributed to that imagery.</p><h2 id=he-said-that-alcohol-took-his-energy-away><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>He Said That Alcohol Took His Energy Away</span></h2><p>Snoop also quit drinking because he wanted to be able to continue working in music, and it is no secret that the fickle music industry tends to favor youthful energy. Because Snoop and other OG rappers are aging like anyone else, to be better able to compete with the new wave of younger more energetic musicians and still able to perform, Snoop decided to start avoiding alcohol.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Inside Snoop Dogg And Martha Stewart's Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=he-has-several-grandchildren><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>He Has Several Grandchildren</span></h2><p>Snoop had his first grandchild in 2015. He now has 3 grandchildren as well as his 4 grown children. Snoop doesn’t seem eager to rob his grandkids and future grandkids of a grandpa, <a href=#>so he is staying healthy</a>. Snoop turned 50 on October 20, 2021.</p><h2 id=the-alleged-roofie-incident><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Alleged Roofie Incident</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to the National Post, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Snoop also stopped drinking in 2014</a> when he became suspicious that a woman at a club drugged his drink with Rophenal, a.k.a. roofies, a drug commonly used to commit robbery or date rate on subdued individuals. That is enough to scare many people away from the bottle forever.</p><h2 id=he-used-to-promote-alcohol-products-and-still-does><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>He Used To Promote Alcohol Products, And Still Does</span></h2><p>Snoop was a brand ambassador for Colt 45 beer until around the mid 2010s, which was around the same time he quit drinking in clubs (2014). While Snoop does not drink alcohol anymore, it seems he has no problem with others drinking. There are still brands of liquor and wine that bear Snoop’s name, face, and brand. 19 Crimes Cali Wines have his picture right on the bottle and they are readily available at any local Total Wines or liquor stores, some of the types of 19 Crimes include Roses, California Reds, and Blush.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Some Key Facts About Tyler, The Creator's Most Controversial Lyrics</a></span></p><h2 id=he-briefly-found-religion-in-the-2010s><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He Briefly Found Religion In The 2010s</span></h2><p>It seems like everyone has just forgotten about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Snoop Lion phase that Snoop Dogg went through</a> about 10 years ago. But around 2011 Snoop Dogg converted to Rastafarianism and changed his stage name to Snoop Lion in order to reflect his new faith. Although when he was done with Rastafarian symbolism in his work, he seems to have just slipped back into his Snoop Dogg identity around 2015 without anyone saying a word about it. More to the point though, Rastafarians do not consume alcohol. Perhaps his stint as a rasta was a part of his path to sobriety from alcohol. Even though Snoop participated in a legit Rasta conversion ceremony in Jamaica, many in the community also rejected him, saying he was merely using rasta images for publicity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=he-had-a-lot-of-help-from-his-oldest-friend><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>He Had A Lot of Help From His Oldest Friend</span></h2><p>It’s important to note that Snoop Dogg’s “sobriety” is sobriety from alcohol. While he has taken the occasional “tolerance break” Snoop is still a synonymous name with cannabis. Many who quit drinking or using hard drugs supplement their consumption with cannabis, which allegedly has properties that reduce things like the symptoms of withdrawal, and its relaxing effect helps take the edge off in a way similar to alcohol but without its negative effects on the liver. If there is one thing Snoop Dogg hasn’t been short on in years it is access to cannabis – he has even added it to his stock portfolio one might say because his company now has a CBD trading platform. The journey to dry up might have been a lot harder for Snoop were it not for his life long love affair with a woman named Mary Jane.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Snoop Dogg and the 10 Celebrities Cashing In On Cannabis</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdqLuwu89mm6ifl2K%2BtrXTZpuroZ6gtq%2BzjJqjnKeYpLlutM6wZg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./willow-smith-says-nepotism-doesnt-apply-interview-1234875524.html>&#171;&nbsp;Willow Smith Downplays Nepotism Label Despite Having Famous Parents</a>
