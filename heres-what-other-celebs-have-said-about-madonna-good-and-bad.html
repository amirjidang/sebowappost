The singer first debuted back in 1983 with her self-titled album and instantly became an overnight sensation. After pushing boundaries and reinventing pop music, Madonna, without a doubt, transformed the industry into what it is today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite breaking records, shocking the world with her outlandish costumes, music videos and lyrics,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Madonna</a> has not only revolutionized music, but she's also managed to create a bit of a reputation for herself as being quite the diva. While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she has certainly earned the right to brag due to her legendary career</a>, many people aren't fans of the singer due to her giant ego.</p><p>Whether it is constantly being late, rude, or throwing shade, many singers and celebrities alike have had a few not so nice encounters with Madonna and weren't afraid to talk about it. Although she may have a few enemies, Madonna has also paved the way for a number of artists, many of which have praised her for her work in the entertainment business. With that being said, here are things celebs have said about Madonna that are both good and bad!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mariah-carey---master-at-throwing-shade><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Mariah Carey - Master At Throwing Shade</span></h2><p>Mariah Carey and Madonna do not appear to be the best of friends and we definitely know why! While the two singers are from different times, considering Madonna debuted in the early 80s and Mariah came out a decade later, the two never had to compete for the top spot, however, that didn't stop them from shading one another. During an interview back in 1995, Mariah claimed that she hasn't "listened to Madonna since the 7th or 8th grade when she used to be popular", taking a job at the fact that Madonna is no longer as relevant as she once was.</p><h2 id=lady-gaga---far-too-many-comparisons><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Lady Gaga - Far Too Many Comparisons</span></h2><p>Lady Gaga and Madonna have had quite a long-lasting feud since Gaga's debut back in the late 2000s. While things started off without any issues between the two, Madonna had a few things to say about Gaga after she released "Born This Way", claiming the song was a rip off of "Express Yourself". Madonna compared the two quite a bit, causing the media to pin the two up against one another. After being asked about the constant comparisons, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lady Gaga referred to them as "moronic"</a> and ensured Madonna knew she wasn't a "plagiarist."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gwyneth-paltrow---friends-to-frenemies><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Gwyneth Paltrow - Friends To Frenemies</span></h2><p>Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow were once upon a time the best of friends, however, things took a turn in their relationship when Paltrow began working with a celebrity fitness trainer, Tracy Anderson, whom Madonna is not a fan of. While there was no defining moment that stirred the pot, Paltrow appeared to have had it with Madonna and her antics, claiming that on top of any resentment towards working with a new trainer, the pop star is always late and "keeps people waiting," something Gwyneth was no longer willing to put up with.</p><h2 id=cher---love-hate-relationship><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Cher - Love-Hate Relationship</span></h2><p>Madonna and Cher are without a doubt two of the biggest pop sensations that defined not only an era of music but shaped the music industry into what we know of it today. Despite both being legends, the two didn't always get along. Cher never "hated" Madonna, but simply always thought she was a "b****". Cher has also spoken out regarding Madonna's talent and how she is one of the "most amazing artists", showcasing that she has a mix of both hate and loving comments when it comes to Madonna.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elton-john---called-madonna-out><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Elton John - Called Madonna Out</span></h2><p>If there is one person who will not put up with Madonna or any of her diva antics, it is Sir Elton John. Not only is Elton John very close to Lady Gaga, and felt some type of way after Madonna accused Gaga of ripping her song off, but the "Tiny Dancer" singer is also not a fan of the fact that Madonna charges an arm and a leg for her shows when she doesn't even sing live. The singer dissed Madge at an awards show after she won the "Best Live Act", when in reality, Madonna lip-syncs at most of her shows.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Elton John Vs Madonna: What We Know About Their Feud</a></span></p><h2 id=patti-lupone---not-a-fan-of-madge><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Patti LuPone - Not A Fan Of Madge</span></h2><p>Patti LuPone, who is a Broadway icon, has had a lot to say about Madonna over the course of her career, and let it all out during an interview on "Watch What Happens Live!" with Andy Cohen. The star revealed that she felt Madonna's portrayal as Evita was an absolute "piece of s***" and claimed that the "Vogue" singer was a "movie killer." Yikes! Patti didn't stop there, she continued to throw as much shade as possible, claiming that Madonna cannot "act her way out of a paper mag."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ariana-grande---looks-up-to-her-immensely><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Ariana Grande - Looks Up To Her Immensely</span></h2><p>While there are many artists and public figures who have a lot of negative things to say about Madonna, there are just as many who have nothing but great things to say about her, one of which is Ariana Grande. The "God Is A Woman" singer has praised Madonna referring to her as a "Queen" and even had the opportunity to dance with her on stage during one of her concerts. Ariana even went as far as to write an open thank you letter to Madonna for all she has done for women in music.</p><h2 id=britney-spears---pop-princess-meets-pop-queen><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Britney Spears - Pop Princess Meets Pop Queen</span></h2><p>If there are two artists who have completely redefined the world of pop music, it is without a doubt Madonna and Britney Spears. The "Express Yourself" singer is referred to as the "Queen of Pop", whereas Britney is known as the "Princess of Pop", so it is only fitting for these two to be friends. Not only are they close, but the two made history at the 2003 Video Music Awards when Madonna, Britney and Christina Aguilera went in for a three-way kiss.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here Is What It's Like To Work For Madonna</a></span></p><h2 id=beyonce---friends-for-years><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Beyonce&nbsp;- Friends For Years</span></h2><p>Many fans of Madonna might not know this, but she and Beyonce are quite the tight-knit duo! The two have been friends for years and actually met through Gwyneth Paltrow. Despite Madonna's falling out with Paltrow, she and Beyonce remain friends to this very day. Bey has also made a number of statements shining nothing but love onto Madonna's career and referred to her as a "visionary" for the work she's done.</p><h2 id=sarah-paulson---massive-fan-of-madonna-s><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Sarah Paulson - Massive Fan Of Madonna's</span></h2><p>While Sarah Paulson and Madonna aren't grabbing coffee over the weekends or going shopping down Rodeo Drive, the two shared quite a special moment at the 2018 Met Gala. Paulson, who had walked the red carpet just before Madonna, had no idea who was coming up behind her. Sarah, who stood on the carpet waiting for the photographers to snap pics of her, realized they were all busy and focused on someone else. As Paulson turned around, she realized just who had arrived and absolutely lost her mind! Sarah is a massive fan of Madonna's so meeting her on the red carpet was nothing short of a miracle for her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here Are All The Men Madonna Has Dated In The Past</a></span></p><h2 id=rosie-o-donnell---has-supported-the-singer-for-years><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Rosie OâDonnell - Has Supported The Singer For Years</span></h2><p>Rosie O'Donnell and Madonna have been friends for years and have both had one another's backs. Madonna, who has been a huge advocate for the LGBTQ+ community, has always been a fan of Rosie's and vice versa. Rosie has always had the best things to say about Madonna and even defended her after Patti LuPone made her less than favorable remarks about the singer. In addition, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Madonna has also had Rosie's back</a>, particularly during Rosie's feud with Donald Trump!</p><h2 id=anderson-cooper---dancing-partners><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Anderson Cooper - Dancing Partners</span></h2><p>Anderson Cooper may be a top CNN correspondent, but he is without a doubt one of the biggest Madonna fans in the world. The journalist, who came out as gay back in 2012, has always had an affinity for Madonna and her music, so much that he was brought on stage during one of her shows and danced the night away with the singer. He and bestie Andy Cohen have partied with Madonna in New York City and occasionally see one another in the city, as both reside in New York.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">14 Forgotten Photos From Madonna's Past</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZKismJq%2Fbq%2FEpZybq12drrexjKyYopxdlq%2BwwdNmpJqcn6O7onnGqKadZZGjsW6uwJ1m</p></div><div id=links><a href=./highest-paid-footballers-2011.html>&#171;&nbsp;Highest-Paid Footballers 2011 Richest Footballers</a>
