But has the fame gone to her head? Does she still remember and talk about her childhood in Vancouver? And has she stayed in touch with the friends she has made throughout her life?</p><h2 id=has-taylor-russell-stayed-close-with-her-friends-from-vancouver>Has Taylor Russell Stayed Close With Her Friends From Vancouver?</h2><p>After <a href=#>co-starring in Bones In All with Timothee Chalamet</a>, Taylor Russell has proven that she is a perfect fit for horror movies. Besides the film about two cannibals, Russell played Zoey Davis in the creepy 2019 movie Escape Room and the sequel, Escape Room: Tournament of Champions, which was released in 2021.</p><p>Before she became famous, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Russell grew up in Vancouver</a>, British Columbia. In an interview with Harper's Bazaar, she explained that she was born in Deep Cove, an area located in North Vancouver. She and her parents began living in Toronto when she was six years old. She told the reporter that she doesn't visit Deep Cove. It's too hard because it has been altered a lot because of how gentrified it's become.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/timothee-chalamet-taylor-russell.jpg><p>Taylor Russell was once good friends with Emilija Baranac, a 28-year-old actress who is also from Vancouver. While she played Heidi in three episodes of the Charmed reboot, she is famous for playing Genevieve in the To All The Boys I've Loved Before Netflix movies. Baranac is also known for playing Midge in Riverdale and her role on Fakes.</p><p>While neither actress has said that they are still friends, they follow one another on social media, which suggests that they keep in touch in some way, shape or form.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/emilija-baranac.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in 2018, Baranac and Russell did a photo shoot with Reema Ismail, a photographer living in Vancouver. They looked like they had a lot of fun. It's possible that they are still friends, and Russell just doesn't talk about it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Breakdown Of The Critically Acclaimed 'Bones And All' Lineup</a></span></p><p>Taylor Russell also starred in the TV series Lost In Space, which began streaming on Netflix in 2018 and ended in 2021. Based on the show from 1965, Lost In Space is about the Robinsons who travel through space. Russell played the oldest sibling Judy Robinson, who is one of the smartest characters on the show.</p><p>Lost In Space was filmed in Vancouver, and also starred Mina Sundwall, Paker Posey, Maxwell Jenkins, Toby Stephens, and Molly Parker. Jenkins was really young at the time that the show filmed, and he's only 18 years now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems that Russell has kept in touch with her co-stars from Lost In Space, which suggests that she does like remembering her life before she became a huge celebrity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/taylor-russell-lost-in-space-costars.jpg><p>Earlier in 2023, Redditor @Butterscotchtape_ posted some adorable photos of Russell and Jenkins having fun together in the SubReddit called "Taylor Russell Updates." The fan wrote, "Taylor Russell with her Lost In Space costar Maxwell Jenkins." It's unclear when this photo was taken, but the actors looked excited to be together, which suggests that they bonded.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Harry Styles Care More About His Fans Than His Girlfriends?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Russell seems to get along well with the actors who she stars in projects with. In 2019, Vogue interviewed Russell and her Waves co-star Alexa Demie, who stars on Euphoria. They shared that they became friends when shooting Waves in Florida.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/taylor-russell-1.jpg><p>Russell said of their friendship, "We would pull cards, angel cards. We would pray together; we prayed a lot, and we would text each other every day if, like, she was on set and I wasn’t, and I knew she had a hard day. We just wanted each other to know we were there for each other. We would drive through Florida, listen to music in the car and sing, try to take it light."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-does-taylor-russell-think-of-her-fame>What Does Taylor Russell Think Of Her Fame?</h2><p>It seems that Taylor Russell does think of her life in two parts: her childhood and everything that came after. But that seems to be because she began acting when she was older. In an interview with Women's Wear Daily, she explained that after living in Vancouver and Toronto, she relocated to Los Angeles when she turned 20. She also began living in New York City in 2019. After high school, she had an agent and kept trying to become an actress, which paid off when she was cast in Lost In Space and Waves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/harry-styles-and-taylor-russell-s-relationship-is-a-downright-mystery-here-s-the-truth-about-whether-or-not-they-dated.jpg><p>The actress told WWD.com that she explored acting when she was 18 years old, but not any earlier. She said, “I would watch movies, and then I would go to my room and I would recite what I remembered from the movie. And I did that for a very long time. I think I was always interested in acting…I think it’s always been there.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Have Any Of Harry Styles' Girlfriends Ended Up Absolutely Hating Him?</a></span></p><p>Russell is 28 years old now and seems to have moved on from her childhood years, but in a positive way. Instead of going to college or university, she has learned a lot on each TV and movie set and has formed important relationships, like with her co-star Demie from Waves. And if she is ever asked about her fame since starring in Bones And All, it's clear that the actress feels a bit overwhelmed at the prospect. She definitely doesn't appear to think of herself as a celebrity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nearly-all-of-timothee-chalamet-s-movies-have-sparked-fiery-dating-rumors-that-fans-still-aren-t-sure-are-false.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Russell talked about Bones And All</a> in an interview with Variety. She answered a question about the start of her acting career. She said, “I don’t really know. I’ve been asked that a lot lately. I wish I had a more simple answer, but, on reflection, ever since I was a little girl, I definitely wanted to be in the arts. I loved dancing, and my ultimate dream was to go to Julliard to be a ballerina.”</p><p>In the same Variety interview, Taylor Russell mentioned that having an agent in Vancouver was a great leg up in the industry. It sounds like she appreciates every chance she has been given and that she loves where she has ended up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdna6zvthmqq2xnJrAbrPIq6Ofqpmau6V505qwpaeiYr%2B2v9Keo6VlkpqzsL7EZqqhnV2XsqStzJ5kn5mdpMK0ew%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./dixie-chicks-change-name-to-the-chicks.html>&#171;&nbsp;Dixie Chicks Change Name To The Chicks To Distance Themselves From Racist Connotations</a>
