As we saw throughout his career, he could truly play any type of role to perfection. He wasn't limited to comedy.</p><p>As it turns out, during the film, he had a hard time connecting with a certain cast member. A lot of the reason was due to the fact that his co-star was a method actor, and keeping his tough exterior alive behind the scenes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We'll take a look at what went down between the two, along with how Williams affected others behind the scenes.</p><h2 id=williams-was-a-joy-to-work-with-for-most>Williams Was A Joy To Work With For Most</h2><p>Not only was he hilarious, but Williams also gave terrific life advice. <a href=#>He touched so many lives behind the scenes</a>, and that includes lots of young actors as well. Lisa Jakub never forgot the great advice Williams gave her during the early portion of her career.</p><p>"One of the most powerful things for me about working with him is that he was very open and honest with me talking about his issues with addiction, depression, and that was so powerful to me at 14. I have struggled with anxiety my whole life."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Robin Williams Trends On Twitter Due To Being Named As The Saddest Celebrity Death</a></span></p><p>Matthew Lawrence echoed that sentiment during his time alongside Robin in the '90s classic, 'Mrs. Doubtfire'.</p><p>"Robin...was like a guiding force. Like he would just, all of a sudden out of the blue look over to me like, 'By the way, don't do drugs! Really messed up my brain! I'm serious. Do not do them.' I was like 'Ok!' That stuck with me."</p><p>Countless celebs had the same experience, however, we can't say the same for Ethan Hawke.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ethan-hawke-had-a-hard-time-dealing-with-his-humor>Ethan Hawke Had A Hard Time Dealing With His Humor</h2><p>A lot of it stems from the fact that Hawke stayed in character, and maintained a tough exterior. According to the actor, <a href=#>Robin was going mad</a>, given that Hawke never left at his jokes off camera.</p><p>"It drove Robin absolutely insane. When Robin sees a person not laughing, it becomes his mission to make them laugh. But I was really trying hard to be in Todd’s skin, and I really didn’t think Todd would think any of this shit was funny.

"At 18, I found that incredibly irritating,” the four-time Oscar nominee continued. “He wouldn’t stop — and I wouldn’t laugh at anything he did.”</p><p>Ultimately, the actor learned a lot of valuable lessons from Williams, "As I get older, I realize there is something intimidating about young people’s earnestness, their intensity,” he told the Karlovy crowd. “It is intimidating – to be the person they think you are. Robin was that for me.”</p><p>Once the film came to an end, Robin played a huge part in getting Hawke set up for his future, helping him land his first agent. What a guy.</p><h2 id=the-film-was-a-huge-success-despite-williams-going-through-hard-times>The Film Was A Huge Success Despite Williams Going Through Hard Times</h2><p>The film was a big success at both the box office and in terms of reviews. With a budget of $16 million, the film turned a profit of $235 million, in large part, thanks to Robin's fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>IMDB has the film rated at an impressive eight of ten stars, which really shows how great the film truly was and still is.</p><p>What's even more surprising, is the fact that <a href=#>Robin was going through some hard times</a> while filming the movie behind the scenes. He was suffering from depression, as his marriage was coming to an end. Yet, despite that, he was able to mask everything and bring joy behind the scenes.</p><p>This speaks volumes at the man he was behind the scenes, always putting others' happiness first.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Travis Scott Reveals The Surprising Reason Why He Looks Up To Robin Williams</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dpLumecCcq6iqXay1sHnSrqmpqpmotq%2Bzy7JknaGUo8Fusc2jprJlp6S%2FrLXNoGSwoaSderO7waKlZq%2BZobmqrcysZJ6smJa7brTAsKKeZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./why-is-george-carlin-stand-up-comedy-still-important-today.html>&#171;&nbsp;The Reason Why George Carlin's Comedy Is Still So Important Today</a>
