Also the <a href=#>"poorest" in the family</a>, it seems like she has a lot "to live up to" like <strong><a href=#>Kylie Jenner</a></strong>'s <a href=#>former billionaire status</a>, for instance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So in 2018, when rumors spread that the reality star-turned-model was bisexual, fans were quick to latch on to the narrative. "Like many already said, this is first because she's very, very private on <a href=#>her relationships</a> (surprisingly for someone so active on insta and in a reality TV show)," a Redditor wrote of that time Kris Jenner might have fueled the gossip.</p><p>That same year, Kendall set the record straight on the speculations. In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her April cover story with Vogue</a>, she admitted that she had been described as having a "male energy." She went on to say that she has "tough energy" indeed. Here's the truth about her sexuality, and her rumored relationship with Bad Bunny.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Money Did Robert Kardashian Leave His Children?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-kris-jenner-really-start-kendall-jenner-39-s-bisexual-rumors>Did Kris Jenner Really Start Kendall Jenner's Bisexual Rumors?</h2><p>In June 2022, a fan on Reddit recalled Kris teasing fans about a "big reveal" from Kendall, which everyone thought that was her coming out as gay. "I still remember that period of time when Kris was teasing that Kendall was gonna have a big reveal and we thought she was coming out," they wrote. "Only for her to come out as... Someone who had acne as a teen ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ just to sell some cheap facewash."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/th-image-template-20.jpg><p>Someone also noted that fans might have fallen for it as Kendall was "the only sister who didn't showcase a relationship on the show. Until recently with Devin she was super secretive about her relationships." They pointed out that "it doesn't seem like she has [a lot] of chemistry with the men she dates," before betting: "I 100% believe she dated Cara [Delevingne] at some point."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While others didn't agree with the Cara theory, one expressed their appreciation for Kendall not "queer baiting" despite being "so close" with her, "it was beyond a friendship." They added that "unfortunately [a lot] of bisexual women celebrities get caught up in expressing their sexuality for the male gaze and I'm glad she's avoided that."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Do The Kardashians Set Unrealistic Expectations For Young Girls? Fans Think So</a></span></p><h2 id=what-has-kendall-jenner-said-about-the-bisexual-rumors>What Has Kendall Jenner Said About The Bisexual Rumors?</h2><p>Kendall knew exactly why she was rumored to be bisexual. "I think it's because I'm not like all my other sisters, who are like, 'Here's me and my boyfriend!'" she told Vogue in 2018. "So it was a thing for a minute because no one ever saw me with a guy. I would always go that extra mile to be low-key with guys, sneaking around all the time. You don't want to, like, look crazy."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/th-image-template-19.jpg><p>Without ruling out the possibility, she clarified: "I don't think I have a bisexual or gay bone in my body. Who knows?! I'm all down for experienceâ€”not against it whatsoeverâ€” but I've never been there before." She added that although she had been described as having a "male energy" â€” which she preferred to label "tough energy" as someone who "moves differently" â€” it doesn't mean she's gay at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I'm not gay," she stated. "I have literally nothing to hide. I would never hide something like that." At that time, she was dating Detroit Pistons player, Blake Griffin. She didn't share much about their relationship in the interview. She confirmed, however: "I like my private life â€¦ I'm happy... He's very nice. I have someone being very nice to me."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kylie Jenner Was 'Shut Out' Of Doja Cat's Met Gala Party, Here's What Their Relationship's Really Like</a></span></p><h2 id=are-kendall-jenner-amp-bad-bunny-really-dating>Are Kendall Jenner & Bad Bunny Really Dating?</h2><p>In February 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sources told Entertainment Tonight</a> that the Puerto Rican rapper, Bad Bunny (real name, Benito Antonio MartÃ­nez Ocasio) has been seeing Kendall. The "relationship is getting more serious," claimed the insider, adding that "He is not only spending more time with Kendall, but with the rest of the family as well."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fw7r1fnaaaievzy.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for Kendall, she's reportedly "enjoying their low-key relationship and is excited about where they're headed." However, the source sees "potential" for it to be more "long term" as the couple is "always laughing and smiling together and have similar family values." One thing's for sure â€” Kendall won't give us a detailed confirmation about these things.</p><p>Back in 2017, she said that she prefers to keep her love life private as it is "something sacred." She explained to Harper's Bazaar at that time: "If I'm not fully, fully in it with someone, why would I make it public to everyone else? If I don't even know what it is, why would I let the world know?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She even said that publicizing her relationships could easily lead to breakups. "It's something between two people, and nobody else's opinion needs to be involved in it," she continued. "People want to start drama. If I had a boyfriend, people are going to say all this stuff that's probably going to cause us to break up."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsCxrdGknJ1lpJ2ybr7Upqarq12ptaLAjKScp5yRoblutsSnpZ6qXayutHnBoqqesKWWuXA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./hilarie-burton-jeffrey-dean-morgans-relationship-timeline-pics.html>&#171;&nbsp;Hilarie Burton, Jeffrey Dean Morgans Relationship Timeline: Pics</a>
