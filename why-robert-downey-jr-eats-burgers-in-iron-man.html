been one to shy away from admitting his troubled past with drug use. The frequency with which he was using illegal substances was to the point where the career that Downey Jr. had built for himself was on the verge of being destroyed. His wife had left him and being arrested was the norm for the Chaplin star. By 1996, Downey Jr. had hit rock bottom and had to make a decision to get clean or give his life over to addiction.</p><p>Downey Jr. had grown up surrounded by all different types of drugs. His father, Robert Downey Sr., whom the <a href=#>Oppenheimer star had a complicated relationship with</a>, was a drug user and introduced his son to marijuana at only six years old. Given the tender age at which Downey Jr. was experimenting with illegal substances, it is surprising that he was able to stay as clean as he did until reaching adulthood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Robert Downey Jr. Is Really Like To Work With According To The Cast And Crew Of His Biggest Movies</a></span></p><p>While there were many attempts at getting sober via rehab and even a stint in prison, nothing seemed to hold. It was not until Downey Jr. had a revelation at a Burger King that he was able to finally put substance abuse in his past, a moment in time that he will forever be grateful to the fast food chain for.</p><h2 id=robert-downey-jr-was-highly-addicted-to-drugs-for-5-years>Robert Downey Jr. Was Highly Addicted To Drugs For 5 Years</h2><p>While Downey Jr. had been using drugs for years by the time he made the move from New York to Hollywood, he was never to the point where he was not able to function professionally. It was when the Ironman star started to hit his stride in 1996 and became very successful on the silver screen that his drug use spiraled out of control.</p><p>Beginning in 1996, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Downey Jr. had become addicted to several drugs, including heroin</a>. His increased substance abuse caused his wife to leave him and not allow the Sherlock Holmes star access to his son.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Downey Jr. lost his home and was bouncing from one rehab to the next, none of which had an effect on him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/robert-downey-jr-looking-concerned.jpg><p>The first time that Downey Jr. was arrested was in June 1996 for speeding. When he was pulled over, officers found cocaine, heroin, and an unloaded gun in the passenger seat. The second arrest came just a month later when he was found passed out at a neighbor's house in their son's bed.</p><p>As a result of these arrests, Downey Jr. was ordered to go to "live-in rehab," attend NA meetings at least five times per week, and submit to drug tests. After Downey Jr. missed a drug test, <a href=#>he was sent to jail for the first time</a>, where he spent over 100 days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After being released in 1998, Downey Jr. quickly went back to his old ways and missed drug testing again. This time, he was sentenced to three years in prison. However, Downey Jr. was released after just one year and began getting back to work in 2000, this time on Ally McBeal.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened Between Robert Downey Jr. And Cillian Murphy During The Filming Of Oppenheimer?</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately, that was short-lived as on Thanksgiving that year, Downey Jr. was arrested again for being under the influence, according to I Am Sober. He was then arrested in April 2001 after wandering the streets barefoot under the influence, which was when <a href=#>he was fired from Ally McBeal with no notice</a>.</p><p>He was placed on probation for three years and during this time, was when Downey Jr. recognized for the first time, that he needed to make a change.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=burger-king-helped-robert-downey-jr-kick-his-drug-habit>Burger King Helped Robert Downey Jr. Kick His Drug Habit</h2><p>In 2003, Downey Jr. was falling back into old habits and using frequently.

"I had that, and this big soda, and I thought something really bad was going to happen."</p><p>While there was not any explanation as to what the sense of dread was, it was enough that instead of using the illicit substances in the car, Downey Jr. drove to the ocean where he got rid of all of his drugs and made the decision to get sober and stay clean from that point forward.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=robert-downey-jr-pays-homage-to-burger-king-in-39-iron-man-39>Robert Downey Jr. Pays Homage To Burger King In 'Iron Man'</h2><p>In Iron Man, Tony Stark is held captive by a group called the Ten Rings for three months.
