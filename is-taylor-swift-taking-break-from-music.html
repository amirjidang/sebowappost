During her time in the spotlight, she has gained so many fans that are always waiting to see what she will release next. Swift has nine studio albums, two re-recorded albums, and six deluxe editions of her albums.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her debut studio album came out in 2006 and was filled with country-sounding music. Fans quite literally fell in love with her rather quickly and since her album titled, Taylor Swift, her music just kept getting better and receiving more praise. Swift stuck with the country sound but also added a pop flair to her albums after her debut one.</p><p><span style=font-size:15px>Most of her albums came out two years apart, so fans didn’t need to wait long for new music. That was until the </span>Reputation<span style=font-size:15px> album. Swift was involved in a lot of drama during 2016, and </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" style=font-size:15px>she stepped away from the spotlight to take some time to herself.</a> Now, fans are wondering whether Taylor's about to take another hiatus from music.</p><h2 id=is-taylor-swift-taking-time-away-from-music>Is Taylor Swift Taking Time Away From Music?</h2><p>The Reputation album was her ultimate comeback. It came out in 2017, three years after her last album. It was the longest her fans had ever waited for an album from her. Swift’s music is relatable, honest, and vulnerable. It’s easy to see why her fans feel so connected to her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Swift took a break before, fans were nervous they wouldn’t get another album from her for a while. But in 2019, Swift released another album, Lover. Two albums in 2020 and two more in 2021.</p><p>Her two albums released in 2021 were re-recorded ones. Fearless (Taylor’s Version) and Red (Taylor’s Version) gave fans “new” music. Swift with her more mature voice sings all of her old music and also includes tracks that never made the original albums.</p><p>The re-recordings have been what Swift has been focusing on in her career. The anticipation to know what is next is always in the minds of her fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=swifties-think-she-might-step-away-from-music-again>Swifties Think She Might Step Away From Music Again</h2><p>So even after all of this new music, fans are nervous that Swift might be stepping away for a bit. Swift recently received an Honorary Doctorate degree in Fine Arts from New York University. <a href=#>She spoke at the 2022 commencement ceremony.</a></p><p>At the ceremony, she made a speech that included her making a joke saying, <a href=#>"getting canceled on the internet and nearly losing my career gave me an excellent knowledge of all the types of wine."</a> This specifically references her break from music back in 2016 due to all the drama she was involved in.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Fans Debate What Taylor Swift's Song "Cardigan" Means</a></span></p><p>What mainly sparked the idea that Swift may be taking a break from music was a TikTok she made the day of the NYU commencement ceremony. Swift is on TikTok and sometimes posts little glimpses into her life. In the video, she shows herself putting on her first-ever cap and gown. She captioned it, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"wearing a cap and gown for the very first time – see you soon NYU."</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The song she used in the background of the video was See you Soon by beabadoobee. The lyrics from the song that stuck out to Swift fans were: "I wanted you to know I need time grow and to exist, I think I need a space, let you know I’m safe."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Taylor Swift's Most Impressive Guinness World Records</a></span></p><p>Fans took to TikTok to make their own videos about the theory that Swift used this song to reference that she won't be releasing any albums soon. This came after Swift has actually announced some new music, so she may not be taking a break after all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=music-to-expect-from-taylor-swift-soon>Music To Expect From Taylor Swift Soon</h2><p>There is one song that is actually confirmed by Swift and her team to come out this summer. This song is titled Carolina and <a href=#>will be featured in the film Where The Crawdads Sing.</a> Fans have only heard two teasers of the song in both of the trailers for the movie. This is the only upcoming song that Swift has actually announced herself.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Taylor Swift Only Has Eight Billboard Number One Hits In Her Career</a></span></p><p>Fans also got extremely good news when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Swift announced and released This Love (Taylor's Version) from the 1989 album.</a> The song will be featured in a television series which is why Swift released the entire song. Swift has also released Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version), also from the 1989 album last year.</p><p>So when she released a second song from 1989, fans were quick to assume that the entire re-recorded album would be released possibly this summer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Both the re-recordings of Fearless and Red were extremely successful</a> and have of course left fans wanting more. While it is not confirmed if Swift is taking a break from music or coming out with 1989 (Taylor's Version) this summer, fans are certainly on the edge of their seats to see what Swift does next.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Biggest Artists Taylor Swift Has Collaborated With, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWklsatu9FmqrChlql6ta3KoqWgZZKnsqK3jJ%2BpqKVdosK0tcJo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./honey-boo-boo-wearing-diamond-engagement-rumors.html>&#171;&nbsp;Honey Boo Boo, 16, Spotted Wearing Diamond On Her Ring Finger</a>
