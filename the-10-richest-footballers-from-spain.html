Although this is unconfirmed (conflicting accounts claim Belgium, France, Denmark, or Sweden as football's birthplace) there’s no doubt that Spain is home to some of the world’s greatest soccer action. Spanish soccer fans are among the most dedicated and fervent in the whole of Europe.</p><p>Every town in the country has a football pitch and team, and it is often said that Spanish kids begin to play football as soon as they learn to walk. It is therefore not uncommon for budding talents to be picked up from around Spain by major clubs for specialized training from an early age.</p><p>Not surprisingly, Spaniards are among the biggest names in the world’s highest paying and most famous football clubs: FC Barcelona, Real Madrid, Manchester United, and Chelsea FC, all boast top-notch Spanish stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Going in to the 2013 FIFA World Cup, the Spanish national team is ranked among the best in the world.
