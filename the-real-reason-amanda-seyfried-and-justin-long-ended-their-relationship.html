In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they're over before they even really begin</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;lack the stuff long-term relationships are made of. But that's Hollywood. It's constantly a game of who dated who.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Oscar nominee&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amanda Seyfried and Justin Long</a> (yeah, we can't picture them together, even though we've seen pictures) dated from the summer of 2013 until 2015. Two years. That's barely any time at all in Hollywood. Sources claimed they split because of conflicting schedules, which (big shocker) is what everyone in Hollywood says when it just doesn't work, and they don't want to be mean. It's one of the most cited reasons for breakups in the business.</p><p>Everyone in Hollywood's busy. Using your schedule as an&nbsp;excuse is lame. If you truly wanted to be with that person, you'd make it work like any of the&nbsp;celebrities in long-term relationships. If it just didn't work, then say that.</p><p>Seyfried has an equally long list of past flings as Long (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she once dated Emile Hirsch</a> while Long once&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dated his co-star Drew Barrymore</a>),&nbsp;so they probably regard their own relationship as just another fling as well. Here's exactly what happened.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-never-officially-confirmed-their-split>They Never Officially Confirmed Their Split</h2><p>It was a bit fishy when Mank's Seyfried, a pretty private celebrity, finally&nbsp;dished on her relationship with Long to Vogue mere months before they broke up.</p><p>She revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they'd started talking after she'd slide into his DMs</a>. It was a&nbsp;funny picture he posted on his Instagram that got her to reach out.&nbsp;Let's just say they didn't end up like Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who started dating after meeting in the same way.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amanda Seyfried Admits She Is All For Making A Third 'Mamma Mia!' Movie</a></span></p><p>"I followed him on Instagram, and I thought something he said was really funny," Seyfried said. "It was a beautiful picture of a snail, and the caption said, 'F------ MOOOOOOOOVE.' It made me laugh out loud, so I texted him."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued to say that she loved their relationship because she could still be herself. "I really do have my own identity, both inside and outside the relationship, if that makes any sense. It just feels right." In the same breath, she also said, "It's also really good to feel OK being alone." Fishy.</p><p>Then she said her career doesn't help her relationship&nbsp;and that she had to be careful with which roles she chose.</p><p>"But making movies is two solid months of twelve-, fourteen-hour days. I mean, it can ruin your relationship," she says. "And if you make too many bad decisions in a row, people don't come knocking anymore."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amanda Seyfried Gives Off Major '70s Vibes In Vogue Australia Shoot Ahead Of The 2021 Oscars</a></span></p><p>Knowing the fate of her relationship with Long, that statement seems ironic. Maybe there was something already going on between them.</p><p>She went on to say she wanted kids and her life "to be the same as it is now, but with a little less stress and a little less work." Yeah, there was definitely trouble because not long after, they split, despite Long telling the Today&nbsp;Show in 2014 that they were "in it for the long haul." They'd also been living together in a $1.9 million apartment in New York City.</p><p>Sources told Us Weekly&nbsp;the reason for their split was because "they had different schedules and different lives. They just grew apart."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another source told Page Six that Long had wanted to get married but that&nbsp;Seyfried wasn't ready to commit, which is also fishy considering her comments about wanting to settle down and have kids months before.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One source said Long was allegedly really heartbroken by it all</a>, but that was it as far as emotions went. They never even commented on their breakup or anything, so it felt like it'd never even happened. As far as Seyfried was concerned, it hadn't. She moved on really quickly.</p><h2 id=seyfried-moved-on-like-it-never-happened>Seyfried Moved On Like It Never Happened</h2><p>Despite sources citing they split due to conflicting schedules, Seyfried acted on the contrary. When the sources said that Long had been heartbroken about it, they also kind of implied that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seyfried had set her eyes on someone else.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Which is probably more the truth than conflicting schedules. Especially since sources saw her with her future husband, Thomas Sadoski, a few weeks later.</p><p>"She seemed really happy and having a great time," one onlooker who saw them together told ET. "Seyfried certainly didn't seem upset."</p><p>When Seyfried first met Sadoski in 2015 while doing the play The Way We Get By, she was with Long, of course, and he'd still been married to Kimberly Hope. But Seyfried told PorterEdit in 2018 that their relationship had been "strictly platonic" during their time starring in the off-Broadway play.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"[He] never flirted, never disrespected his wife," Seyfried said. "That was another reason why I thought, later on, that I could marry him."</p><p>Conveniently, they both split from their other halves around the same time. In 2016, they confirmed their relationship; six months after that, they got engaged, and in March of 2017, they tied the knot in a private ceremony while Seyfried was nine months pregnant with their firstborn daughter. They gave birth to their second child this past September.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Much Is Actress Amanda Seyfried Worth?</a></span></p><p>So it looks like Seyfried set her eyes on Sadoski not long after her interview with Vogue, where she was gushing about her relationship with Long. Then she high-tailed it out of there, leaving Long in the dust and settled down with her new husband and her baby girl not three years later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But it's okay. Long probably wasn't too hurt by the breakup. He started a relationship the following year with Lauren Mayberry, lead singer of CHVRCHES. They only survived until 2018, but Mayberry denies ever having a relationship with Long. Ouch. Let's hope Long nabs his soulmate one day.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amanda Seyfried Reacts To Her Performance In 'Mank' Being An Oscar Favorite</a></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dp7KiuIyrnJqrn6N6ornAp5uaZaOaxqe%2ByJ6bZpmemXqrwdKtoKdlnKS7qHnEp5uenF2ptaa10WapnqSRqbawutKhoKln</p></div><div id=links><a href=./chelsea-houska-weight-loss-scandal-how-she-did-it.html>&#171;&nbsp;The Truth About Chelsea Houska's Dramatic Weight Loss</a>
